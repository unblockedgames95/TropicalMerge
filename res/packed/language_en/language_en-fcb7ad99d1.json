Anyone heard a legend about a wise panda, a keeper of the dragon's lore?","Quest.drproducer1a_0.step3":"A panda with answers, eh? Better than a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.","Quest.drproducer1a_0.step4":"Then it's decided. We seek out the sage panda. With any luck, she'll shine light on our path.","Quest.drproducer1a_0.step5":"To wisdom then! May this panda guide us through the fog of uncertainty.","Quest.drproduct0a_0.step1":"I still find it strange to see a panda on the dragon island.","Quest.drproduct0a_0.step2":"Strange or not, she has stories to tell—about the Holy Dragon that once harvested wheat here.","Quest.drproduct0a_0.step3":"Really? Did she share anything else?","Quest.drproduct0a_0.step4":"Only hints. But she'll reveal more if we take over the wheat harvest in the dragon's absence.","Quest.drproduct0a_0.step5":"Well, we can't leave a mystery unsolved. To the wheat fields we go!","Quest.drcustomermain3_1.step1":"Withered trees, silent gong... Wait, are these dragon footprints?","Quest.drcustomermain3_1.step2":"Indeed these are. Apparently, without the Holy Dragon, everything has fallen apart.","Quest.drcustomermain3_1.step3":"It feels as if life here hinges on the Holy Dragon's presence. We must find it.","Quest.drcustomermain3_1.step4":"And we must also tend to these ruins. There's a balance we need to restore.","Quest.drcustomermain3_1.step5":"Agreed. But let's tread carefully. Who knows what caused this desolation... or where the dragon has gone.","Quest.drproducer2a_0.step1":"We've delivered the wheat as promised. And look, the panda has given us a scroll.","Quest.drproducer2a_0.step2":"She said to take it to the Sacred Lake. Claims it holds the key to restoring harmony.","Quest.drproducer2a_0.step3":"It all sounds very vague... but also intriguing. A mystery wrapped in an enigma.","Quest.drproducer2a_0.step4":"Indeed. Yet, there's a thrill in the unknown. Let's set out for the lake with hopeful hearts.","Quest.drcustomerbridge1_0.step1":"A bridge that's seen better days. Like everything else here... Do you think we can find collateral treasure for all our trouble there?","Quest.drcustomerbridge1_0.step2":"Perhaps. A secret island often holds secrets of its own. Yet, our main quest mustn't be sidelined.","Quest.drcustomerbridge1_0.step3":"Agreed, the dragon remains our priority. But if fortune favors the bold, we might just hit two birds with one stone.","Quest.drcustomerbridge1_0.step4":"Well said. We repair the bridge, uncover what's hidden, and keep our eyes on the prize—the harmony of this realm.","Quest.drcustomerbridge1_0.step5":"Then let's get to work. For treasure, for truth, and for the adventure that beckons us forward!","Quest.drproducer1b_0.step1":"All this renovation work... I'm starting to feel more like a builder than an adventurer. Could there be a shortcut to fix the temple and bring back the dragon?","Quest.drproducer1b_0.step2":"The dragons whispered of a northern nomad with an eagle companion. She might just be our ticket to speeding things up.","Quest.drproducer1b_0.step3":"An eagle-eyed ally in the north? Let's seek her out and barter for information. I am certain that her bird has seen more of these lands than any map could show us.","Quest.drproduct0b_0.step1":"I can't believe we found her before turning into ice sculptures! Do you think it was worth braving the cold?","Quest.drproduct0b_0.step2":"Absolutely. She requested carrots for her eagle companion, and in exchange, we'll receive its magical feathers.","Quest.drproduct0b_0.step3":"Well then, let's make this trade quickly. The sooner we have those feathers, the sooner we can witness their magic at work.","Quest.drproducer2b_0.step1":"The nomad accepted our carrot with a nod. In her silent way, she's given us the topknot feathers.","Quest.drproducer2b_0.step2":"These aren't just any feathers. They hold an aura of ancient magic. But how do we unlock their power?","Quest.drproducer2b_0.step3":"The dragons hinted at a Place of Power. We are to present these feathers there as offerings.","Quest.drproducer2b_0.step4":"Offerings? Then it's not just a trade but a tribute. It's said that the Place of Power rewards those who honor the old ways.","Quest.drproducer2b_0.step5":"Let's make haste then. If we present these feathers with respect, we may just get what we need."},"dragonia_unitStories_json":{"UnitStory.drbattlepass_0.dragonia2.step1":" Welcome back, team. I'm glad you're here. We've got a problem. The loggers have arrived, and they're planning to cut down the Tree of life.

How hard can it be?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_1.dragonia2.step2":" We need to find the first branch that holds the mystical flower. We'll need to climb up there, so yeah, it might not be that easy.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_2.dragonia2.step1":" This path is treacherous. Watch your step.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_2.dragonia2.step2":" Don't worry, I'll keep an eye out for everyone.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_2.dragonia2.step3":" Look at all these beautiful flowers.

We don't know what dangers lie ahead.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_3.dragonia2.step1":" This path is getting more dangerous. Are we getting close to the flower?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_3.dragonia2.step2":" Yes, we're almost there. Keep your eyes peeled for any signs of danger.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_4.dragonia2.step1":" Do you hear that? It sounds like something is moving in the bushes.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_4.dragonia2.step2":" I'll go check it out.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_4.dragonia2.step3":" Be careful. We don't know what's out there.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_5.dragonia2.step1":" Look at the size of these vines. We'll have to cut through them.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_5.dragonia2.step2":" Be careful not to damage the Tree of Life. It's our most valuable asset.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_6.dragonia2.step1":" This is it, the entrance to the next stage of the Tree of Life. It's said to be guarded by a powerful enchantment.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_6.dragonia2.step2":" Do you think you can break it?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_6.dragonia2.step3":" I can certainly try. But we need to be careful. The enchantment may have a dangerous side effect.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.dragonia2.step1":" The enchantment is stronger than I thought. It's going to take some time to break it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.dragonia2.step2":" We don't have much time.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.dragonia2.step3":" I know. Just keep an eye out for any danger while I work on this.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_8.dragonia2.step1":" We've made it.

It's a decoy.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_9.dragonia2.step1":" We need to find the real flower, and fast.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_9.dragonia2.step2":" Any ideas where it could be?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_9.dragonia2.step3":" Wait, I remember something. The legend said the flower only blooms at night.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_10.dragonia2.step1":" Then we must wait until nightfall.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_10.dragonia2.step2":" But how will we find it in the dark?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_10.dragonia2.step3":" The flower is said to glow in the moonlight. We just need to keep our eyes open.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_11.dragonia2.step1":" Look, up there, on the highest branch!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_11.dragonia2.step2":" That's it! We need to climb up there and get it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_11.dragonia2.step3":" Be careful, the Tree of Life is not to be trifled with.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia2.step1":" Hold on, what's that sound again?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia2.step2":" It's coming from over there, behind those bushes.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia2.step3":" I sense something powerful nearby.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia2.step4":" Look, there's a hidden passage!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia2.step5":" This could be our chance to find the real flower. Let's go!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_13.dragonia2.step1":" Finally, we made it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_13.dragonia2.step2":" And just in time, the loggers are getting closer.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_13.dragonia2.step3":" We need to use the flower to stop them.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.dragonia2.step1":" Wait, there's something written on this tree.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.dragonia2.step2":" What does it say?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.dragonia2.step3":" \"Beware the guardian of the flower.\"","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.dragonia2.step4":" What could that mean?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_15.dragonia2.step1":" I sense a powerful presence nearby.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_15.dragonia2.step2":" Is it the guardian?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_15.dragonia2.step3":" It's hard to say. We need to be cautious.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.dragonia2.step1":" Look, there it is. The guardian of the flower.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.dragonia2.step2":" That doesn't look friendly.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.dragonia2.step3":" We must fight it to protect the flower.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.dragonia2.step1":" Wait, let's think for a moment. Maybe there's another way.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.dragonia2.step2":" What do you suggest?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.dragonia2.step3":" Maybe we can reason with it. After all, it's been protecting the flower for a long time.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_18.dragonia2.step1":" It's worth a shot. But how do we communicate with it?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_18.dragonia2.step2":" I can try to speak to it using the ancient language of the forest.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_18.dragonia2.step3":" Be careful. We don't know what kind of magic it might possess.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_19.dragonia2.step1":" I'll try to reason with the guardian. Wish me luck!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_19.dragonia2.step2":" Hurry, the loggers are getting closer!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.dragonia2.step1":" The guardian heard my plea and let us take the flower.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.dragonia2.step2":" Great! What did it say?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.dragonia2.step3":" It said that our intentions are good, but that we must not forget that with great power comes great responsibility.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.dragonia2.step4":" Now, let's hurry back and use it to stop the loggers.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_21.dragonia2.step1":"So, how do we use the flower to stop the loggers?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_21.dragonia2.step2":"We have to ground it and spread its particles all over Dragonia from the highest branch of the tree.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_22.dragonia2.step1":"I can see the loggers! They are coming closer to the tree of life. They are going to chop it down any moment now.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_22.dragonia2.step2":"How far are we on grinding the flower so far?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_22.dragonia2.step3":"We're very close! Just win us some more time.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_23.dragonia2.step1":"The magic flower powder is ready. Let's spread it!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_23.dragonia2.step2":"I hope this works. Because, if it doesn't, we are all doomed.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_24.dragonia2.step1":"Oh my god, I think our plan worked. The loggers dropped their axes and saws and are preparing a picnic now.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_24.dragonia2.step2":"What a fantastic sight. Let's go help them set everything up. We deserve a proper feast!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_25.dragonia2.step1":"Once again, thank you for saving our land. I and the dragons are grateful.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_25.dragonia2.step2":"Don't mention. It's always a pleasure to be back.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_25.dragonia2.step3":"I hope that the next time we meet under less daunting circumstances.","UnitStory.dr2elf_0.dragonia2.step1":"The craftsman mentioned that we have an impressive demand.

Her assistance will undoubtedly expedite the construction process.","UnitStory.dr2field_0.dragonia2.step1":"Have you noticed how many of the locals are in need of wheat for their crafts? We could fill that void.","UnitStory.dr2field_0.dragonia2.step2":"I see, we grow the wheat, they get the resources they need, and we get something in return.","UnitStory.dr2field_0.dragonia2.step3":"Indeed. Remember, the more we cultivate, the more opportunities open up for us. Let's start planting!","UnitStory.drproducertrash_0.dragonia3.step1":"Our progress is steady, but we could use a bit of wisdom to enhance our production.","UnitStory.drproducertrash_0.dragonia3.step2":"There's a sage in the village, an old soul with ancient knowledge. Perhaps he could lend us his expertise.","UnitStory.drproducertrash_0.dragonia3.step3":"An old Chinese sage, you say? They say such sages are bridges to the past, with secrets for the present.","UnitStory.drproducertrash_0.dragonia3.step4":"Let's pay him a visit. The right word from a wise man can often clear the path better than a day's labor.","UnitStory.drproducertrash_0.dragonia3.step5":"To the sage, then. A few moments with him could spare us hours of toil.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_0.dragonia3.step1":"Doesn't this place look familiar? The birthing place of the legendary Terracotta Army... just  like in the prophecy. We need to restore five ancient relics to bring harmony back to these lands.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_0.dragonia3.step2":"But how can we possibly find the rest? We're new to this island.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_0.dragonia3.step3":"These relics are hard to miss due to their grandeur. Apart from the army, We're looking for The Pagoda, The Dragon, The Garden, and The Castle. We can use stars collected from erecting buildings to restore the relics.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_0.dragonia3.step4":"Okay, and if we're ever stuck?","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_0.dragonia3.step5":"We have the ultimate guide - just a tap away. It'll show us where to find what we need and how to use it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_5.dragonia3.step1":"Marvel at our work! From raw earth to a silent battalion standing guard. The Terracotta Army is complete.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_5.dragonia3.step2":"A sight to behold indeed. And if legend holds true, this army is but one of many secrets buried in the folds of Dragon Island.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_5.dragonia3.step3":"Then this is just the beginning. With the army complete, who knows what other ancient structures await our touch?","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_5.dragonia3.step4":"Let's keep our eyes open as we journey. If this island is truly a canvas of hidden wonders, we shall be the ones to uncover them all.","UnitStory.drbattlepass2_5.dragonia3.step1":"Behold, the pagoda stands complete! A magnificent addition to Dragon Island's landscape.","UnitStory.drbattlepass2_5.dragonia3.step2":"Truly a cause for celebration. Our efforts have borne fruit, and this structure now stands as a beacon of our journey.","UnitStory.drbattlepass2_5.dragonia3.step3":"Yet, I can't help but feel this is just the beginning. The island still holds many secrets, many more structures to unveil.","UnitStory.drbattlepass2_5.dragonia3.step4":"Agreed. Each building we erect is a step deeper into the island's lore. Our adventure is far from over.","UnitStory.drbattlepass3_5.dragonia3.step1":"The statue is restored! Once again, the imperial dragon stands tall, a majestic sight to behold.","UnitStory.drbattlepass3_5.dragonia3.step2":"Our efforts have breathed new life into this ancient guardian. It feels like we've rekindled a piece of the island's soul.","UnitStory.drbattlepass3_5.dragonia3.step3":"But our journey doesn't end here. The island still whispers of untold projects, waiting for our touch.","UnitStory.drbattlepass4_5.dragonia3.step1":"The garden is ready! Every element is in place, achieving perfect harmony. A true oasis of peace.","UnitStory.drbattlepass4_5.dragonia3.step2":"It's more than just a garden; it's a testament to balance and beauty. We've really outdone ourselves this time.","UnitStory.drbattlepass4_5.dragonia3.step3":"But is our work here truly over? Dragon Island still holds so many mysteries, so many paths untraveled.","UnitStory.drbattlepass4_5.dragonia3.step4":"You're right. While we've achieved harmony here, the island's whispers still call to us, beckoning us to new adventures.","UnitStory.drbattlepass4_5.dragonia3.step5":"Then let's answer that call. Our journey continues, as long as there's a mystery to solve, a story to uncover.","UnitStory.drbattlepass5_5.dragonia3.step1":"It's done. The castle stands majestic and proud. Our journey's work is now a part of the island's skyline.","UnitStory.drbattlepass5_5.dragonia3.step2":"And the rewards we've gathered are bountiful. But truly, being part of this journey... that's the real treasure.","UnitStory.drbattlepass5_5.dragonia3.step3":"Absolutely. The skills we've honed, the secrets we've uncovered, the bond we've forged with this land and each other...","UnitStory.drbattlepass5_5.dragonia3.step4":"It's more than I ever imagined when we first set foot on Dragon Island. We've built structures, but also, we've built memories.","UnitStory.drbattlepass5_5.dragonia3.step5":"Let's take a moment to cherish this. We've done something extraordinary. And while our work here is complete, the adventure... it never really ends.","UnitStory.drproduct2a_0.dragonia3.step1":"Panda was right. Reading the contents of the scroll by the sacred lake revealed the truth.","UnitStory.drproduct2a_0.dragonia3.step2":"It's dragon crystal – rarest mineral in whole of Dragonia. I am not surprised that this is the only thing that can bring the Holy Dragon back.","UnitStory.drproduct2a_0.dragonia3.step3":"Let's collect as many of them as we can and apply them. If we don't return the dragon in time, this realm will be forever lost.","UnitStory.drcustomermain3_1.dragonia3.step1":"I can't believe my eyes! We managed to bring the Holy Dragon back.","UnitStory.drcustomermain3_1.dragonia3.step2":"He said that he was possesed by an evil witch and is very thankful for his salvation. He will grant his ultimate treasure island once the Holy area is fully restored.","UnitStory.drcustomermain3_1.dragonia3.step3":"That's very nice of him. But we should be careful from now on. Who know's what is the evil witch is capable of now that she lost her catch.","UnitStory.drproducer2a_0.dragonia3.step1":"This must be the Sacred Lake, shimmering with a light that seems to dance on the water's surface.","UnitStory.drproducer2a_0.dragonia3.step2":"It's exactly as the panda described. Speaking of which, isn't this the place where we're supposed to read the scroll she gave us?","UnitStory.drproducer2a_0.dragonia3.step3":"Yes, you're right. The scroll's secrets are to be revealed here. The waters might hold the key to decoding its mysteries.","UnitStory.drproducer2b_0.dragonia3.step1":"This must be the Place of Power. It feels charged with an ancient energy.","UnitStory.drproducer2b_0.dragonia3.step2":"The perfect spot to present the magical feathers. The air's almost humming with anticipation.","UnitStory.drproducer2b_0.dragonia3.step3":"Let's do this with reverence. These feathers are more than just gifts; they're symbols of our journey and respect for this land.","UnitStory.drproducer0a_0.dragonia3.step1":"Here they are, the wheat beds. This is what the panda sought.","UnitStory.drproducer0a_0.dragonia3.step2":"They've been untended for some time. The dragon's absence is felt even in the grain.","UnitStory.drproducer0a_0.dragonia3.step3":"Let's get to work then.

It’s oddly bright and cheerful... Almost enchanting in a non-spooky way.","Quest.hlcastle_find.step4":"We should get a closer look. Maybe there is a tiny spider web or a baby ghost not visible from afar...","Quest.hlcastle_0.step1":"On the second thought, even if we hang a bat in one of the corners, the castle will still look too cheerful, don't you agree?","Quest.hlcastle_0.step2":"You’re right. There’s a persistent aura of enchantment that our decorations alone cannot dispel.","Quest.hlcastle_0.step3":"This must be the work of a potent spell, something that mere decorations cannot counteract.","Quest.hlcastle_0.step4":"Disenchanting a fairy’s work is tricky... We’ll need help from the mystical beings of the island.","Quest.hlcastle_0.step5":"Let’s embark on a quest, then! We must find someone who can help us lift the spell and bring the full spooky back to this castle in time for Halloween!","Quest.hlcastle_1.step1":"It's obvious, though, that mere decorations won't break the spell. The fairy’s enchantment is deeply woven into the castle’s very stones.","Quest.hlcastle_1.step2":"Our quest continues, then. To truly bring the Halloween spirit to this castle, we must delve deeper into the mysteries of disenchantment alongside our new allies.","Quest.hlcastle_2.step1":"Look at how far we’ve come! The castle, once cheerfully enchanted, now begins to whisper tales of the eerie and the unknown.","Quest.hlcastle_2.step2":"Indeed, each cobweb and shadow brings us closer to a true Halloween spectacle. But the final threads of the enchantment still linger.","Quest.hlcastle_2.step3":"The fairy’s magic is potent, but we’ve gathered allies, knowledge, and spooky decorations that have begun to pierce through its cheerful veil.","Quest.hlcastle_2.step4":"We are on the brink! Let’s muster our courage, gather our wits, and dispel the remaining enchantment to unveil a castle truly fit for Halloween!","Quest.hlhag_0.step1":"To disenchant the castle, we’ll need potent magic, something beyond our abilities.","Quest.hlhag_0.step2":"I’ve heard tales of a local Alchemist, dwelling deep within the mystical woods, who possesses the power to counter even the strongest enchantments.","Quest.hlhag_0.step3":"Ah, the Alchemist of the woods!

Now, the alchemist can brew her potent concoctions once more.","UnitStory.hlcaldron_7.step3":"But we mustn’t forget, the elixir for the mummy requires specific, perhaps enigmatic, ingredients.","UnitStory.hlcaldron_7.step4":"True, we must scour the land, from murky swamps to enchanted groves, to gather what is needed for the brew.","UnitStory.hlflittermouse_0.step1":"Behold, the bat egg, a rarity in our mystical realm, now lies within our grasp!","UnitStory.hlflittermouse_0.step2":"A monumental find! The mummy held true to its word, guiding us to this precious beginning.","UnitStory.hlflittermouse_0.step3":"I hope it enjoyed every last drop of the elixir.

Yet, even as the bat will soon take wing, our journey is far from its end.","UnitStory.hlspider_0.step1":"Look at this, a spider egg, delicately wrapped in the finest of silken threads, now in our hands!","UnitStory.hlspider_0.step2":"An eerie yet exciting discovery! These eight-legged architects will surely spin a web of fright throughout the castle!","UnitStory.hlspider_0.step3":"I can already imagine the moonlight gently illuminating the delicate, dew-kissed webs on a crisp Halloween night.","UnitStory.hlspider_0.step4":"And think of the shadows they'll cast! But let’s not get too entwined in the future, our quest is still weaving its path ahead of us.","UnitStory.hlcandle_0.step1":"Ah-ha! The first light, a beacon in our dark quest, is now found!","UnitStory.hlcandle_0.step2":"Its ghostly glow pierces through the darkness, promising to cast eerie shadows across our castle!","UnitStory.hlcandle_0.step3":"But one light alone cannot dispel the lingering cheerfulness of the fairy’s enchantment. We must seek the candelabra to amplify its spectral glow.","UnitStory.hlcandle_0.step4":"Indeed, the eerie candelabra, legendary for its haunting luminescence, will be the key to enveloping the castle in a truly spooky aura!","UnitStory.hlgnome_0.step1":"Wow, we've uncovered the first stage of the Halloween gnome!","UnitStory.hlgnome_0.step2":"Oh, this is thrilling!

I thought you retired.","Quest.wood_1.step2":"Somebody had to take care of the island after your grandpa disappeared. Will you help me get more of it?","Quest.wood_1.step3":"Of course. Thank you for inviting me. Although I feel sad that we had to meet in these circumstances.","Quest.wood_1.step4":"Me too, but I'm still very happy to see you!","Quest.wood_3.step1":"What should we do about this haystack?","Quest.wood_3.step2":"Nothing yet. We’ll need far more hay if you want to bring back the island’s glory.","Quest.wood_3.step3":"I’m not sure how greatness relates to hay but you’re much more well-versed in what’s happening here so I trust your judgment.","Quest.wood_4.step1":"How farming is going to help us find my grandpa?","Quest.wood_4.step2":"Patience, Lisa. Archibald is my best friend and I want to find him as much as you do. But we should also take care of the island.

Archibald is my best friend and I want to find him as much as you do. But we should also take care of the island. Otherwise, he will have nothing to come back to.","Quest.wood_6.step1":"I still don't get it. I remember coming here when I was a little girl. It was absolutely packed with animals and plants. What happened?","Quest.wood_6.step2":"That’s why you’re here. To help us solve this mystery. Your grandpa already tried to but disappeared. You’re our only hope to find him and save the island!","Quest.wood_6.step3":"Okay, let's bring back life here!","Quest.wood_7.step1":"What was the last thing you remember my grandpa do?","Quest.wood_7.step2":"He was obsessed with those amulets you brought from the Exchange. He told me that they were the key to solving everything.","Quest.wood_7.step3":"Okay, now we know what we should look for. And as you said, let’s not forget about keeping the island habitable.","Quest.king_1.step1":"Look! It’s an axe. Should we use it to chop our way through the thicket?","Quest.king_1.step2":"Can you really handle it? I know I can’t. But I'm acquainted with someone who knows how to handle it!","Quest.king_2.step1":"What if we don't find this mysterious axe person? Time is running out and the island needs us.","Quest.king_2.step2":"Relax. He is somewhere here since he has nowhere else to go. We just have to look better.","Quest.dragonisland_1.step1":"There is a place where we can try our luck and look for Archibald...","Quest.dragonisland_1.step2":"Great! Can you take me there?","Quest.dragonisland_1.step3":"It's too dangerous for us alone. But maybe Axel will go with us?","Quest.dragonisland_1.step4":"Alright, I'll talk to him. But I can't promise anything since this man is so stubborn.","Quest.bear_1.step1":"Excuse me, did you get lost? I’m sorry, but you don’t look like someone who belongs on this island.","Quest.bear_1.step2":"For your information, my grandfather, Archibald Whitlock, was the one who discovered this place.

I hope the two of you’ll hit it off.","Quest.bear_2.step3":"Alright, I’ll be on my best behaviour.","Quest.bear_3.step1":"Isn’t it ironic? I’m looking for my grandpa and you’re looking for your granddaughter…","Quest.bear_3.step2":"Oh, well, I’m not surprised since Marina was spending a lot of time with Archibald. She was probably the last one to see him.","Quest.bear_3.step3":"That’s great! I already cannot wait to meet her.","Quest.bear_4.step1":"It feels bad to say it, but you probably know grandpa better than me. Do you have the slightest idea where he might be?","Quest.bear_4.step2":"Lizzy, darling, if I’d knew I wouldn’t involve you in this. The only way we can find him is as a team.","Quest.bear_4.step3":"And our team isn’t full without Marina so let’s conclude our search!","Quest.bear_5.step1":"Maybe you know what’s happening on the island?","Quest.bear_5.step2":"I would love to say that I do but I haven’t lived here long enough to get acquainted with all the intricacies.","Quest.bear_5.step3":"Did you live here long enough to get acquainted with my grandpa?","Quest.bear_5.step4":"I did. Actually, this axe was a gift from Mr. Whitlock. I hope it will help us get to Marina as soon as possible.","Quest.candies_4.step1":"I thought that I remembered the island being full of fruit! This means that we’re on the right track.","Quest.candies_4.step2":"Well done, Lizzy! Let’s collect them and take to the Exchange.","Quest.wood_9.step1":"Do you think it's a big enough farm to start with?","Quest.wood_9.step2":"Are you kidding? It's perfect. It will definitely help us to put things back on track.","Quest.wood_9.step3":"Great! Then, let's do our best to restore it.","Quest.stone_1.step1":"The island is already looking much better, don’t you think?","Quest.stone_1.step2":"Indeed it does but there is still enough space for farming. Let’s take advantage of it.","Quest.stone_2.step1":"How everything is going with your poultry project?","Quest.stone_2.step2":"It’s fine, thank you. Lizzy is very helpful when it comes to finding resources.","Quest.stone_2.step3":"She is a special one. Keep an eye on her so she doesn’t get into trouble.","Quest.stone_3.step1":"Our poultry is growing. Should we start building a shed for it?","Quest.stone_3.step2":"Not yet. Let’s wait and see how big it can get.","Quest.stone_4.step1":"How come you know so much about farming? You look more like a…","Quest.stone_4.step2":"Forester? I owe everything I know to my grandpa too so we have more in common than you might think. ","Quest.stone_4.step3":"Maybe you can teach me a thing or two so I don’t come bothering you every time I need help.","Quest.stone_4.step4":"Not at all. It’s an honor helping you with the island and the search.","Quest.stone_5.step1":"How come you know so much about farming? You look more like a…","Quest.stone_5.step2":"Forester? I owe everything I know to my grandpa too so we have more in common than you might think. ","Quest.stone_5.step3":"Maybe you can teach me a thing or two so I don’t come bothering you every time I need help.","Quest.stone_5.step4":"Not at all. It’s an honor helping you with the island and the search.","Quest.stone_6.step1":"It’s time for you to learn how to use an ax. Let’s build something!","Quest.stone_6.step2":"Finally! I was waiting for you to say that because I hate the feeling of not being busy.","Quest.stone_7.step1":"Did you know that the chickens were the first thing your grandpa found on the island?","Quest.stone_7.step2":"Really? Looks like we’re getting back to the roots.","Quest.stone_7.step3":"We’ll build the nicest farm those chickens have ever seen!","Quest.stone_8.step1":"Do you need my help, guys? It feels strange to watch you do all the work.","Quest.stone_8.step2":"Don’t worry, uncle Roger. You’ll get many more chances to contribute since we have a lot of work ahead of us.","Quest.stone_10.step1":"The chicken coop looks ruined!","Quest.stone_10.step2":"Of course, it was abandoned for a very long time. Grab the tools, let’s restore it!","Quest.wagon_1.step1":"Is your offer to help us still standing, uncle Roger? We need to build a barn to store things in.","Quest.wagon_1.step2":"I would love to but my lower back is killing me. Let’s see if Marina is available.","Quest.wagon_2.step1":"Marina, Darling, do you mind helping Lisa and Axel with their new project?","Quest.wagon_2.step2":"It will be my pleasure. The island was very kind to me all these years and it’s time to pay it back.","Quest.wagon_3.step1":"You know, I was about your age when my grandpa took me here for the first time.","Quest.wagon_3.step2":"I didn’t know that. Did you like it?","Quest.wagon_3.step3":"It was the best. I refused to go home but he told me that I can come back any time I want.","Quest.wagon_3.step4":"Don’t worry, Lisa. We’ll make the island even better than it was before and find your grandpa!","Quest.wagon_4.step1":"Look at you, girls. You’ve done a pretty amazing job!","Quest.wagon_4.step2":"Well, I’ve had a pretty good tutor.","Quest.wagon_4.step3":"It looks like I have nothing left to teach you so I’m just going to help you.","Quest.wagon_5.step1":"Why do you need a barn anyway?","Quest.wagon_5.step2":"Some people like to keep things in order, you know.","Quest.wagon_5.step3":"Even if you have nothing to store in there I can always occupy it with my surfboards.","Quest.wagon_6.step1":"Is there a way to make it even bigger? Much bigger.","Quest.wagon_6.step2":"Sure. We just need to find more resources. Much more.","Quest.wagon_6.step3":"Leave it to me and Marina!","Quest.wagon_7.step1":"It’s almost the same as it was before, am I right, Marina?","Quest.wagon_7.step2":"Yep. Let’s make Axel responsible for bringing wood in while we remodel the building?","Quest.wagon_7.step3":"Sounds like a great plan!","Quest.wagon_8.step1":"Wow, I had no idea that you wanted it to be so grand.","Quest.wagon_8.step2":"We’re not done yet. We need more wood to finish the construction.","Quest.wagon_8.step3":"More than I’ve already brought in?","Quest.wagon_8.step4":"What can I say, we have a lot of things that need storage.","Quest.wagon_10.step1":"Are we finally finished?","Quest.wagon_10.step2":"Yeah, I think so. This looks about right.","Quest.wagon_10.step3":"Duly noted. I’ll keep it in mind when we start working on another structure.","Quest.elf_1.step1":"Do you know whose this is? We’re desperate for someone with gardening skills.","Quest.elf_1.step2":"Ah, yes. How did I forget about Gloria. I’m the last person on this island she is going to help.","Quest.elf_1.step3":"I don’t know what happened between the two of you but let’s try and talk to her.","Quest.elf_2.step1":"Be honest, uncle Rodger, what did you do?","Quest.elf_2.step2":"Why do you presume that it was something I did? There’re always two people in a relationship.","Quest.elf_2.step3":"Grandpa always told me that you’re impossible to date. \"Too free-spirited\", he would say.","Quest.elf_2.step4":"The first part hurts. But the second one is true. Hopefully, she’ll find it in her heart to forgive me.","Quest.elf_3.step1":"Was Gloria close with grandpa?","Quest.elf_3.step2":"You can say that. He used to consult her a lot about gardening the last past month before he disappeared. ","Quest.elf_3.step3":"If we find out what he was asking her about it could be our first clue to finding him.","Quest.elf_4.step1":"Look, this rake also belongs to aunt Gloria.","Quest.elf_4.step2":"Maybe you know where we could find her?","Quest.elf_4.step3":"Let’s just follow the trace of her tools. I’m pretty sure she is busy in the garden.","Quest.elf_5.step1":"Are you any good at gardening?","Quest.elf_5.step2":"I guess flowers are too gentle for my rough hands.","Quest.elf_5.step3":"Don’t be so harsh on yourself. Golden hands remain golden no matter what you use them for. ","Quest.elf_5.step4":"Thank you, Lizzy. Although you’re being too kind to me I appreciate your kindness.","Quest.warlock_1.step1":"Do you have any leads already?","Quest.warlock_1.step2":"Not really. We were hoping that you could help us out.","Quest.warlock_1.step3":"Okay, let’s start the investigation by finding out whose hook this is.","Quest.warlock_2.step1":"I just wanted to take a moment and thank you for deciding to help us despite whatever reservations you might have had.","Quest.warlock_2.step2":"Don’t mention it, darling. It’s nice to finally meet you in person.","Quest.warlock_2.step3":"Did grandpa talk about me?","Quest.warlock_2.step4":"Only all the time! I hope this lure will lead us to him so you could ask him yourself.","Quest.warlock_3.step1":"How are you doing, uncle Roger?","Quest.warlock_3.step2":"I think we’re handling this like adults.","Quest.warlock_3.step3":"I’m so proud of you. Do you think this float will lead us somewhere?","Quest.warlock_3.step4":"There is only one way to find out, Lizzy!","Quest.warlock_4.step1":"Do you mind taking a look at this box? I think of you as an expert on kits like this.","Quest.warlock_4.step2":"What can I say, I’m honored. I can tell you straight away that it belongs to someone from the Ocean Guild.","Quest.warlock_4.step3":"Ocean Guild? Why does it sound so familiar…","Quest.warlock_4.step4":"Maybe because your grandfather founded it. Come on, let’s find the box’s owner!","Quest.warlock_5.step1":"I think it’s very nice what we’re doing here, Gloria. Don’t you think so?","Quest.warlock_5.step2":"Don’t get any ideas, Roger. I’m doing this for Lizzy and Archibald.","Quest.warlock_5.step3":"Of course! Me too… Let’s see what else we can find.","Quest.warlock_6.step1":"Do you like fishing yourself? I’ve only seen you with an ax.","Quest.warlock_6.step2":"I can’t say that I do. It seems rather difficult to me.","Quest.warlock_6.step3":"Really? We finally found something that I can teach you.","Quest.warlock_6.step4":"I’ll definitely take you up on that, Lisa. Now, let’s focus on the Ocean Guild.","Quest.magicplant_1.step1":"You were right, Lizzy. It seems like it evolves.","Quest.magicplant_1.step2":"Indeed it does. I bet we can make it grow even bigger! Let’s find more rocks to find out what they’re supposed to become.","Quest.magicplant_2.step1":"Do you know what it is?","Quest.magicplant_2.step2":"Looks like an ordinary coral to me. Although it reminds me of something…","Quest.magicplant_2.step3":"My grandpa always told me that there is no such thing as an ordinary coral on a tropical island. Let’s dig deeper!","Quest.magicplant_3.step1":"How do you like it now, uncle Roger?","Quest.magicplant_3.step2":"I knew it looked familiar! I saw the drawings in Archibald’s office after he disappeared. Seems like he was onto something.","Quest.magicplant_4.step1":"Do you think we can obtain more shells to find out what becomes of them? ","Quest.magicplant_4.step2":"Sure, we’re a team and we’ll do everything in our power to see this through.","Quest.magicplant_5.step1":"Do you have any idea what this shell might be capable of?","Quest.magicplant_5.step2":"Not really. But since Archibald was interested in them I bet it’s worth our time and effort.","Quest.magicplant_6.step1":"What if grandpa didn’t want us to look for him? Or follow-up on any of his leads.","Quest.magicplant_6.step2":"I know Archibald well enough to say he always makes sure that things happen for a reason. It might as well be a part of his plan.","Quest.magicplant_7.step1":"It looks like we've done everything there is to do. Don't you think?","Quest.magicplant_7.step2":"According to the drawings, there is something else missing. Let’s continue our search!","Quest.magicplant_8.step1":"Almost there. We need the access to the pearl before we can start testing.","Quest.magicplant_8.step2":"I know I say it a lot but now is a perfect time for it: Archibald would’ve been so proud.","Quest.magicplant_8.step3":"I hope so, uncle Roger. Thank you for the support.","Quest.troll_1.step1":"Axel, I’ve found this knife and it has your family name engraved on it.","Quest.troll_1.step2":"Good. That means that she’s somewhere nearby.","Quest.troll_1.step3":"Your wife? I didn’t know you were married.","Quest.troll_1.step4":"I’m not. It’s my sister’s. She can help us find Archibald.","Quest.troll_1.step5":"What a relief! That your sister is nearby. Let’s look for her.","Quest.troll_2.step1":"Does anyone need this flask? If not, I would like to plug the hole in my boat with it.","Quest.troll_2.step2":"Your boat has holes in it? Why would you endanger my grandpa like this?","Quest.troll_2.step3":"I didn’t. I dropped him safely at the destination but damaged my vehicle on the way back. It was a tricky location.","Quest.troll_2.step4":"I’m afraid I can’t let you have this flask since it also belongs to my sister. But we’ll find you a proper patch while you tell us more about Archibald.","Quest.troll_3.step1":"So, where exactly did you take my grandpa?","Quest.troll_3.step2":"I don’t remember the exact coordinates but there was a map.","Quest.troll_3.step3":"And how did you puncture the boat?","Quest.troll_3.step4":"There were many reefs around. I thought I did a pretty good job but some sneaky one must have scratched the bottom.","Quest.troll_4.step1":"Is this by any chance a map Archibald gave you?","Quest.troll_4.step2":"As a matter of a fact, it is. Not the one he gave me but an exact copy.","Quest.troll_4.step3":"How can you tell the difference?","Quest.troll_4.step4":"Your grandpa’s had his last name on it whereas this one has Hoffman written in the corner.","Quest.troll_5.step1":"I thought you were exaggerating when you said that your sister will help us find my grandpa.","Quest.troll_5.step2":"I thought so too. They were close but I didn’t know he left her the map that leads… Where does it lead to?","Quest.troll_5.step3":"He didn’t say much and I try not to interrogate the customers of my water taxi. It’s good manners, you know. I was hoping he would recommend my services to someone.","Quest.troll_5.step4":"I don’t know anyone who would want to take a ride in a sinking boat. We better keep looking for Elena!","Quest.troll_6.step1":"I’m so excited to meet Elena. Not just because she was close to grandpa but because she is your sister. And we get along pretty well, don’t we?","Quest.troll_6.step2":"Yes, Lizzy, we make a great team. The island hasn’t been the same since you graced it with your presence.","Quest.troll_7.step1":"I see you’re looking for Elena? Maybe I know where she might be.","Quest.troll_7.step2":"Where have you been, uncle Roger? We’ve been looking for her for quite some time.","Quest.troll_7.step3":"Well, you know me. I was contemplating some crazy ideas about the island but now I can take a break and help you look for Axel’s sister!","Quest.bamboo_1.step1":"I have an idea I wanted to discuss with you, Lizzy.","Quest.bamboo_1.step2":"Sure, uncle Roger. What do you have in mind?","Quest.bamboo_1.step3":"When I saw this piece of wool I thought that it might be nice to build a sheep farm. But it will take time and effort and I can’t do it without you.","Quest.bamboo_1.step4":"Of course, I’ll help you! Besides, sheep are my favorite. They’re incredibly cute.","Quest.bamboo_2.step1":"Did you hear about our new endeavor?","Quest.bamboo_2.step2":"Nope. What is it?","Quest.bamboo_2.step3":"We’re building a sheep farm. So be sure to bring every piece of wool that you can find on the island to us.","Quest.bamboo_2.step4":"Roger that.","Quest.bamboo_3.step1":"You never rest, do you?","Quest.bamboo_3.step2":"How do you mean?","Quest.bamboo_3.step3":"Since you came to the island it’s never been a day without it getting better in one way or another. What can I do to help?","Quest.bamboo_3.step4":"You flatter me, Axel. But it doesn’t mean that I’ll refuse your help with collecting the wool.","Quest.bamboo_4.step1":"Do you even know anything about raising sheep?","Quest.bamboo_4.step2":"Not at all. But you showed me that it’s possible to learn on the job.","Quest.bamboo_4.step3":"I’m so glad to hear that. I’ve always dreamed about inspiring people.","Quest.bamboo_5.step1":"It’s essential for us to find as many sheep as we can so we could have a rich flock.  ","Quest.bamboo_5.step2":"Don’t worry, uncle Roger. We’re the best at finding stuff.","Quest.bamboo_5.step3":"Yes, grandpa, you can count on us!","Quest.bamboo_6.step1":"By the way, why sheep? I haven’t been to many tropical islands but I had something more exotic in mind.","Quest.bamboo_6.step2":"There will be time for exotic, don’t worry. The important thing to remember is that it’s our island. We can do here anything we want!","Quest.bamboo_7.step1":"You’ve been here long enough to decide if you prefer bustling city life to farming on a tropical island. What would it be?","Quest.bamboo_7.step2":"I had my share of reservations in the beginning but knowing you all made me fall in love…","Quest.bamboo_7.step3":"Fall in love?","Quest.bamboo_7.step4":"Yes, with this place. Plus, I wouldn’t in a million years trade looking at these cute creatures for living in the city.","Quest.bamboo_8.step1":"To be honest, I’m a little surprised myself that we could find so many sheep on the island.","Quest.bamboo_8.step2":"And I’m sure that we can find even more. Ain’t no mountain is high enough for us.","Quest.bamboo_8.step3":"That’s so true, Marina. I’m so happy that we’re friends.","Quest.bamboo_10.step1":"Do you think it’s enough or should we do something to tidy up it a little?","Quest.bamboo_10.step2":"It’s definitely not what uncle Roger pictured. Let’s renovate it before he sees it.","Quest.sapphire_1.step1":"Hey guys, does anyone know where this feather came from?","Quest.sapphire_1.step2":"I have no idea. The one thing I know is that it’s so pretty!","Quest.sapphire_1.step3":"I’m so glad you found it. Help me get more if you want to know what I’m up to. ","Quest.sapphire_2.step1":"There you go, uncle Roger. Now, tell us about your plan.","Quest.sapphire_2.step2":"It’s nice that you’re so curious because I was about to ask for your help with my peafowl hatchery.","Quest.sapphire_2.step3":"Your what?","Quest.sapphire_2.step4":"Enough with the chit-chat. Let’s get more eggs!","Quest.sapphire_3.step1":"You weren’t joking when you said that you have a new, even crazier project in mind.","Quest.sapphire_3.step2":"I don’t like kidding around, kiddo. We’ll have a lot of fun building this farm.","Quest.sapphire_3.step3":"I doubt it. There aren’t many peafowls on the island.","Quest.sapphire_3.step4":"Don’t worry, Lizzy. If we were able to find sheep here, we’ll find peafowls.","Quest.sapphire_4.step1":"Do you still think that this peafowl idea is crazy?","Quest.sapphire_4.step2":"No. This is one of your best ideas so far. Look how cute they are!","Quest.sapphire_4.step3":"Then you wouldn’t mind helping me find even more?","Quest.sapphire_4.step4":"Absolutely not! What are we waiting for?","Quest.sapphire_5.step1":"Uncle Roger, do you remember so many different species being on the island before?","Quest.sapphire_5.step2":"Hm… You’ve got me thinking, Lizzy. No, not really.","Quest.sapphire_5.step3":"What if grandpa’s disappearance is somehow related to this spike in natural diversity?","Quest.sapphire_5.step4":"Interesting theory, Lizzy. We should definitely look into that!","Quest.sapphire_6.step1":"I’m so sorry, but I overheard your conversation with Roger. About your grandpa.","Quest.sapphire_6.step2":"It’s okay. Do you think I’m mad?","Quest.sapphire_6.step3":"On the contrary. I find it very interesting. Maybe I can introduce you to someone when we finish this peafowl project.","Quest.sapphire_6.step4":"Thank you, Axel. It’s so nice of you!","Quest.sapphire_7.step1":"I know you prefer flora to fauna so I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your help.","Quest.sapphire_7.step2":"It’s my pleasure. Just remind me how our search for peafowls will help us find Archibald?","Quest.sapphire_7.step3":"We don’t know yet. There are too many questions waiting to be answered. But even if we don’t find him this time, we’ll keep the island full of life. That’s what he would’ve wanted.","Quest.sapphire_8.step1":"I see how involved you’re in this peafowl project. Does this mean that the sheep aren’t your favorites anymore?","Quest.sapphire_8.step2":"No one can compete with the wonderful bundles of wool. I just love helping people.","Quest.sapphire_8.step3":"I didn’t know that I do too before I met you.","Quest.sapphire_9.step1":"Can I ask you a question, grandpa?","Quest.sapphire_9.step2":"Sure, darling. What is it that you want to know?","Quest.sapphire_9.step3":"How do you come up with these insane ideas?","Quest.sapphire_9.step4":"I just let the island talk to me and listen to what it has to say. Now it’s telling me that we need to find more peafowls!","Quest.sapphire_11.step1":"What is it?","Quest.sapphire_11.step2":"It’s a start. We’ll build on that until we make the best peafowl hatchery in the world!","Quest.sapphire_11.step3":"Your enthusiasm is so contagious, Lizzy. Let’s get to work!","Quest.knight_1.step1":"Uncle Roger, is this magnifier related to one of your projects?","Quest.knight_1.step2":"No, Lizzy, I’m still on the lookout for the next great idea. But your finding got me curious. ","Quest.knight_1.step3":"Okay then. Let’s see where it leads us!","Quest.knight_2.step1":"Uncle Roger, is this magnifier related to one of your projects?","Quest.knight_2.step2":"No, Lizzy, I’m still on the lookout for the next great idea. But your finding got me curious. ","Quest.knight_2.step3":"Okay then. Let’s see where it leads us!","Quest.knight_3.step1":"Oh my god, look what I’ve found. This issue says about \"The great Archibald Whitlock falling a victim of his genius.\" What can it possibly mean?","Quest.knight_3.step2":"I don’t know, Lisa… But I hope the person to whom it belongs has the answer!","Quest.knight_4.step1":"Things just got more interesting. I know that it’s wrong to read other’s notes without permission, but take a look at it.","Quest.knight_4.step2":"\"Archibald Whitlock, born April 3rd, 1961. The last know location is Dragon Island. Current location - unknown. Objective: find and deliver to the client.\"","Quest.knight_4.step3":"What do you think?","Quest.knight_4.step4":"I don’t know what to think. But let’s not let this stop us. I’m sure we will figure this out.","Quest.knight_5.step1":"Do you think it might be your grandpa’s fingerprints?","Quest.knight_5.step2":"I’m not sure how could someone else get them… But I also have no idea how did someone else know that Grandpa was on the Dragon Island.","Quest.knight_5.step3":"And who else wants to find him?","Quest.knight_5.step4":"Exactly. There’re so many questions. Let’s try to find the answers.","Quest.knight_6.step1":"I also found this camera but the film is light-struck.","Quest.knight_6.step2":"It’s a pity. It could’ve been an answer to some of our questions.","Quest.knight_6.step3":"Don’t worry, we’ll find them anyway.","Quest.knight_7.step1":"A gun? What’s that supposed to mean? I’m not sure anymore if I want to find the owner of all these items.","Quest.knight_7.step2":"It’s okay, Lisa. We’ve got your back. Plus, I believe that there is an explanation for all that. We just have to be patient.","Quest.knight_8.step1":"Are there any recordings or is the tape ruined?","Quest.knight_8.step2":"It seems like this voice recorder is blank since it was never used before.","Quest.knight_8.step3":"Maybe we can use it when recording the answers to all of our questions.","Quest.knight_9.step1":"Finally, something I can actually use.","Quest.knight_9.step2":"Uncle Roger, don’t you like your own hat?","Quest.knight_9.step3":"I do, Lizzy, it’s my favorite one. But there is no such thing as too many hats!","Quest.woodgenerator_1.step1":"Do you know what is this place?","Quest.woodgenerator_1.step2":"It's definitely related to some ancient civilizations judging by the signs engraved on it.","Quest.woodgenerator_1.step3":"Do you think grandpa can be trapped in there?","Quest.woodgenerator_1.step4":"I'm not sure if we'll find Archibald inside but some discoveries are inevitable if we enter!","Quest.woodgenerator_2.step1":"I had no idea that the island is so full of beautiful places. Can explore it? ","Quest.woodgenerator_2.step2":"Sure, Lizzy. That's what Archibald did too. You're indeed his granddaughter.","Quest.woodgenerator_2.step3":"Thank you for saying that. I miss him so much.","Quest.woodgenerator_2.step4":"Don't worry. We'll do everything to find him!","Quest.fruitshop_0.step1":"Did you know that there was a fruit kiosk on the island?","Quest.fruitshop_0.step2":"I'm starting to think that I know nothing about the place where I've spent my whole life... ","Quest.fruitshop_0.step3":"Don't be so dramatic. Let's find out what it has to offer!","Quest.resourceshop_0.step1":"Look, Lisa, I've found a store too.","Quest.resourceshop_0.step2":"What do they sell there?","Quest.resourceshop_0.step3":"I have no idea but probably something useful for restoring the island!","Quest.discountshop_0.step1":"I've noticed how much do you like shopping. I know just a place for you!","Quest.discountshop_0.step2":"It better be something really special since I already know where to get my fruit and resources.","Quest.discountshop_0.step3":"Don't worry. I wouldn't waste your time on something that basic. The gems you can find here will make the island shine!","Quest.crystal_1.step1":"Look, uncle Roger. I’ve found something.","Quest.crystal_1.step2":"What a pretty little pearl, Lizzy. Just like yourself. What’s it for?","Quest.crystal_1.step3":"I don’t know, I was hoping you’ll tell me.","Quest.crystal_1.step4":"Well, I guess we’ve just signed up for another adventure…","Quest.crystal_2.step1":"It’s not a mere pearl, as it turns out. Looks like some sort of an ancient stick.","Quest.crystal_2.step2":"It doesn’t surprise me at all considering the fact how long did this island exist before it was found by Archibald.","Quest.crystal_2.step3":"And like with everything here it should serve its own purpose.","Quest.crystal_2.step4":"There is no doubt about that, Lizzy! Let’s find out what it does.","Quest.crystal_3.step1":"All these signs look so curious, uncle Roger. Are you proficient in ancient languages?","Quest.crystal_3.step2":"Unfortunately, I’m not as smart as your grandpa. But something tells me that our ability to read those can be the key to solving this mystery.","Quest.crystal_use.step1":"I knew this thing looked familiar!","Quest.crystal_use.step2":"Are you saying that you actually know what it is?","Quest.crystal_use.step3":"I can’t say I’m sure but I might have an idea what should we do with it.","Quest.crystal_use.step4":"That’s what I wanted to hear, uncle Roger. Just tell me what to do.","Quest.crystal_use.step5":"Let’s take the Sceptre and put it next to something to watch ancient magic unfold. ","Quest.kraken_0.step1":"What is the oldest tradition here on the island?","Quest.kraken_0.step2":"Fishing, of course! We can use the tropical amulets to lure the fish and then trade it to get rewards.","Quest.snow_1.step1":"I was minding my own business when I found… I don’t even know what is it? The smallest tusk in the world?","Quest.snow_1.step2":"I think it’s a great way for you to get to know Elena a little better. You should ask her to help you figure this thing out.","Quest.snow_2.step1":"Hey, Elena! I keep on finding strange things. Do you have any idea where did this egg come from?","Quest.snow_2.step2":"I’m so glad you came to me with this question, Lisa. I know exactly what these are. Let’s get some more eggs so I could show you something! ","Quest.snow_3.step1":"It was a crocodile egg all along? I don’t know why it didn’t occur to me…","Quest.snow_3.step2":"No worries, the island’s fauna is so vast it’s easy to get lost. Would you like to see where the rest of them live?","Quest.snow_3.step3":"Sure! How can you say no to another tropical adventure?","Quest.snow_3.step4":"Okay, buckle up then! It’s not an easy place to get to but it’s worth it.","Quest.snow_4.step1":"I can see that you and Elena are getting along well.","Quest.snow_4.step2":"What can I say, this happens when two great people meet. In all seriousness, though, she is just wonderful and full of knowledge. It’s a pleasure working with her.","Quest.snow_4.step3":"I love my sister and all but let me know when she tires you with her expertise.","Quest.snow_4.step4":"That’s a strange thing to ask… But sure, I will.","Quest.snow_5.step1":"Do you know how many teeth a crocodile has? And did you know that they love fruit? And they can swim really fast.","Quest.snow_5.step2":"I don’t…","Quest.snow_5.step3":"And they can hold their breath for a whole hour! And sleep with one eye open. What was it that you wanted to say?","Quest.snow_5.step4":"Oh, nothing really. You do know your crocodiles, that’s for sure.","Quest.snow_5.step5":"Not only crocodiles! Wait until I tell you all about every species you can find on the island.","Quest.snow_6.step1":"I think it’s happening…","Quest.snow_6.step2":"What is? I don’t know what are you talking about.","Quest.snow_6.step3":"Oh, stop it, Axel! You know perfectly well what I mean. Do you want me to say that you were right and I was wrong?","Quest.snow_6.step4":"It’s always nice to be right, I won’t argue with that. But you don’t have to say anything. I’ll talk to her and make sure that she goes easy on you.","Quest.snow_7.step1":"Hey sis, do you mind turning it down a notch with Lisa? She appreciates your scholarship but she was hoping to learn more about her grandpa, not the crocs.","Quest.snow_7.step2":"Oh, I’m sorry. You know how overly excited I get when it comes to nature.","Quest.snow_7.step3":"I do. Just stop trying to teach and help to learn instead.","Quest.snow_8.step1":"So, Lisa, what does it feel like being a granddaughter of the greatest adventurer in the world?","Quest.snow_8.step2":"I don’t really know, to be honest. I didn’t spend too much time with grandpa since he was always… somewhere, you know?","Quest.snow_8.step3":"Yep… This is the price you pay for being a pioneer. But he always had you in mind. ","Quest.snow_8.step4":"How do you know?","Quest.snow_8.step5":"He said so himself.","Quest.snow_9.step1":"One time I was on an expedition with Mr. Whitlock. He gave me the map with my name on it.","Quest.snow_9.step2":"The one we found earlier?","Quest.snow_9.step3":"Yes. I asked your grandpa why put my name on the map. And he told me that this is what he does. He once even named an island Lisa, after his granddaughter.","Quest.snow_11.step1":"Wow, look at that! It’s an actual crocodile pond.","Quest.snow_11.step2":"It is. But we can make it even better. Let’s find more crocodiles to populate it with.","Quest.hunter_1.step1":"Do you have relatives left in other places?","Quest.hunter_1.step2":"Yes. Why do you ask?","Quest.hunter_1.step3":"Maybe we can use this stamp to send them a letter asking if they know where Archibald might be.","Quest.hunter_1.step4":"I like the idea but we’re going to need more stamps than that!","Quest.hunter_2.step1":"I figured that we also need some envelopes if we want to send out the letters…","Quest.hunter_2.step2":"I was so excited about these beautiful stamps that I completely forgot about the most important thing.","Quest.hunter_2.step3":"Don’t worry, I’ll help you collect the envelopes so that you have some time and strength for the letter itself.","Quest.hunter_3.step1":"I think it’s a good idea to write several letters to all of my relatives around the world.","Quest.hunter_3.step2":"You have quite a family, don’t you? Is there anything I can do to help?","Quest.hunter_3.step3":"Sure. We need to figure out a way to deliver the letters…","Quest.hunter_4.step1":"I have great news, Lizzy!","Quest.hunter_4.step2":"What is it, Axel?","Quest.hunter_4.step3":"There is a postman on an island. Once we find him, we can start sending the letters!","Quest.hunter_5.step1":"I have great news, Lizzy!","Quest.hunter_5.step2":"What is it, Axel?","Quest.hunter_5.step3":"There is a postman on an island. Once we find him, we can start sending the letters!","Quest.hunter_6.step1":"Did you know that such big parcels were being sent from the island?","Quest.hunter_6.step2":"I didn’t even know that there was a world beyond the island before I’ve met you.","Quest.hunter_6.step3":"It’s so sweet of you, Axel. I hope that these boxes will help us find what we’re looking for.","Quest.hunter_7.step1":"Uncle Roger, can you, please, help us find someone on the island?","Quest.hunter_7.step2":"Of course, sweetheart. As long as it’s not your grandpa, I can help you locate anyone!","Quest.hunter_7.step3":"Great! We’re looking for a local postman. This bag belongs to him.","Quest.hunter_7.step4":"There is a postman? What an unexpected turn of events. Let’s find him together!","Quest.hunter_8.step1":"How come you’ve never met the local postman before? Didn’t you see boxes like this scattered all over the island?","Quest.hunter_8.step2":"I guess I was too busy worrying about other things. Like finding your grandpa…","Quest.hunter_8.step3":"I’m sorry that this thought didn’t occur to me.","Quest.hunter_8.step4":"Not at all. Maybe this mysterious postman knows where he is!","Quest.hunter_9.step1":"Anyway, how did this whole search for the postman begin?","Quest.hunter_9.step2":"Axel came up with this great idea to send out letters to my relatives, asking if anyone knew where grandpa might be.","Quest.hunter_9.step3":"Nice thinking. You and Axel make a great team!","Quest.hunter_9.step4":"Do we? I don’t know. Maybe. I guess we do! Let’s put the envelopes into the mailbox.","Quest.lava_1.step1":"Uncle Roger, there is something you’ve got to see!","Quest.lava_1.step2":"Oh my, Lizzy. Would you do me the honor and follow this trace with me?","Quest.lava_2.step1":"Honestly, this is not exactly what I expected to see.","Quest.lava_2.step2":"I thought you became used to being surprised since you moved to the island.","Quest.lava_2.step3":"Yes, but when I see a paw print I expect to see a cat.","Quest.lava_2.step4":"I’m sure we’ll find one if we keep looking!","Quest.lava_3.step1":"Isn’t he adorable? Can we keep him?","Quest.lava_3.step2":"Of course, Uncle Roger. Although I had something else in mind…","Quest.lava_4.step1":"Do you want me to have two cats instead of one? I like the idea!","Quest.lava_4.step2":"Actually, I was hoping to help you have as many cats as you wish to have.","Quest.lava_5.step1":"I appreciate the idea, Lizzy, and this ginger cutie pie is irresistible, but I don’t think that I have enough space at home for all of them.","Quest.lava_5.step2":"That’s why I was thinking about an outdoor enclosure to keep all of your feline friends!","Quest.lava_6.step1":"I had no idea there were leopards on the island.","Quest.lava_6.step2":"Me neither. But when Elena found one of them and told Axel about it he knew right away what to get you for your birthday.","Quest.lava_7.step1":"So, this was all just an act to set me on the right path?","Quest.lava_7.step2":"It was, Uncle Roger. It was the only way to ignite true excitement in you.","Quest.lava_7.step3":"And ignite it you did! I’m so looking forward to new discoveries.","Quest.lava_7.step4":"Let’s find more panthers then and see where they are going to lead us.","Quest.lava_8.step1":"But, Lizzy, how did you know that I love cats?","Quest.lava_8.step2":"First of all, who doesn’t?! Secondly, you love all the animals. And, finally, Axel told me.","Quest.lava_8.step3":"Really? I didn’t think he would remember.","Quest.lava_8.step4":"He is a very good listener. A great one, actually…","Quest.lava_9.step1":"So, Axel, I guess I have to thank you for this quest you presented to me.","Quest.lava_9.step2":"Not at all. It was all girls. Elena found the cats, and Lisa prepared the itinerary.","Quest.lava_9.step3":"Don’t sell yourself short. You still have a huge role to play in all of it.","Quest.lava_11.step1":"Well, Axel, it’s your time to shine!","Quest.lava_11.step2":"What do you mean?","Quest.lava_11.step3":"You didn’t think I would indulge myself with intense labor on the day of my birth, did you?","Quest.lava_11.step4":"Don’t worry, Axel. I’m here to help!","Quest.centaur_1.step1":"So, are you ready to tell us what you know about my grandpa?","Quest.centaur_1.step2":"Yes. But first things first. I’ve come a long way, and it’s time to eat.","Quest.centaur_1.step3":"You’re lucky we’ve stumbled on a fork. Let’s find something edible and get back down to business.","Quest.centaur_2.step1":"A whisk? Does it mean I have to cook first?","Quest.centaur_2.step2":"Not to worry. I will assist you. After all, I came here from Paris.","Quest.centaur_2.step3":"Can you cook while telling me about my grandpa?","Quest.centaur_2.step4":"Maybe. We will see. First, we need to get more tools.","Quest.centaur_3.step1":"Look! It’s a ladle. We’ve reached our culinary summit, haven’t we?","Quest.centaur_3.step2":"We have a long way to go, madam. To make something truly delicious, we would need more than that.","Quest.centaur_4.step1":"Hey, how is it going? Is everything okay?","Quest.centaur_4.step2":"Marcel won’t talk to me until he eats, and the only thing I can think about is grandpa!","Quest.centaur_4.step3":"Don’t worry, Lizzy. I’ve got your back. I can search for the cooking tools while you ask him the necessary questions.","Quest.centaur_4.step4":"You have wonderful friends. Hold on to them. Okay, what is it that you want to know?","Quest.centaur_5.step1":"When was the last time you saw Archibald?","Quest.centaur_5.step2":"I never did.","Quest.centaur_5.step3":"What do you mean?","Quest.centaur_5.step4":"We only communicated through mail. I enjoyed every moment of it.","Quest.centaur_6.step1":"Why did you decide to come here?","Quest.centaur_6.step2":"I really liked your grandpa and wanted to see him in person. He convinced me that my services are really needed on the island.","Quest.centaur_6.step3":"Why didn’t you meet?","Quest.centaur_6.step4":"There was a trip he needed to go to. Is he back already?","Quest.centaur_7.step1":"So, Archibald has never come back from the trip? And you have no way of reaching him? And you were hoping that I was the key to finding him?","Quest.centaur_7.step2":"Yes, yes, and yes. This is exactly the case.","Quest.centaur_7.step3":"I’m sorry I let you down. Let me make you something special with all the tools you kindly provided.","Quest.centaur_8.step1":"Did I spoil your appetite?","Quest.centaur_8.step2":"Not really. It’s not your fault. And I am excited to learn what’s on that plate. I’m just starting to lose hope…","Quest.centaur_8.step3":"If it’s any consolation, you did find an exquisite set of tools. They make me feel like home.","Quest.centaur_8.step4":"Wait a minute… Since we didn’t have any tools, the ones we found had to belong to someone. You’re a genius, Marcel!","Quest.sand_1.step1":"I don’t mean to be rude, uncle Roger, but how is your eyesight?","Quest.sand_1.step2":"So far so good, Lizzy. Thank you for asking. But why?","Quest.sand_1.step3":"I just wanted to make sure that you didn’t step on these spikes.","Quest.sand_1.step4":"Wow, I didn’t see them there. Now that I have, I want to know where did they come from.","Quest.sand_2.step1":"How do you always do this, uncle Roger?","Quest.sand_2.step2":"Do what, Lizzy?","Quest.sand_2.step3":"Drag me into your adventures!","Quest.sand_2.step4":"I don’t know… But do not say that you are not curious about what’s inside this egg.","Quest.sand_3.step1":"Oh my god, this hedgehog is so cute!","Quest.sand_3.step2":"I share your enthusiasm, Lizzy, but let’s be quieter. We don’t want to wake it up.","Quest.sand_3.step3":"And let’s watch our step. Its spikes might not be as big but they are still pretty sharp.","Quest.sand_4.step1":"What have we got here? A party we weren’t invited to?","Quest.sand_4.step2":"I’m so sorry, Axel. These hedgehogs… They make you forget about the rest of the world.","Quest.sand_4.step3":"Tell me about it! Elena is crazy about them.","Quest.sand_4.step4":"She is? Oh my god, I feel awful. Please, join us in finding new species. I won’t take no for an answer!","Quest.sand_5.step1":"I used to have one just like it. Do you remember?","Quest.sand_5.step2":"How could I forget Gregory… The scars he left will forever remind me of…","Quest.sand_5.step3":"Don’t be so dramatic, Axel. Instead, we should thank Lizzy for taking us along.","Quest.sand_5.step4":"Not at all, guys. I promise to never forget about you when presented with an opportunity to embark on another journey!","Quest.sand_6.step1":"Why do you love hedgehogs so much?","Quest.sand_6.step2":"I don’t know. Something is exciting about them. I always wanted to be as cute and tough as they are.","Quest.sand_6.step3":"Well, you can cross it off your list. You are gorgeous and plow through the jungle like it’s your playground. If it’s not tough I don’t know what is.","Quest.sand_7.step1":"Where did hedgehogs go?","Quest.sand_7.step2":"I don’t think this porcupine will tell us so we have to figure it out ourselves.","Quest.sand_8.step1":"Who is that?","Quest.sand_8.step2":"I have no idea. But it kind of looks like a… dinosaur.","Quest.sand_8.step3":"I think I know what’s happening here. Follow me!","Quest.sand_9.step1":"Yep, it was definitely a dinosaur before! Where did you bring us, Uncle Roger?","Quest.sand_9.step2":"I can’t believe that it’s actually happening.","Quest.sand_9.step3":"What is?","Quest.sand_9.step4":"I need to make sure of something before I can tell you. Try to find more dinosaurs while I’m away.","Quest.sand_11.step1":"Wow, this place looks abandoned. Do you know what this is?","Quest.sand_11.step2":"I have no idea what this is but I bet we can turn it into something truly wonderful!","Quest.asia_1.step1":"Look, uncle Roger. I believe that this ancient coin can help us get all the answers. ","Quest.asia_1.step2":"Yes indeed. This is our best chance to find the truth. Let’s make it count!","Quest.asia_2.step1":"Are you excited to find out more about your grandpa’s accomplishments?","Quest.asia_2.step2":"Yes, for sure. But I am also quite worried at the same time.","Quest.asia_2.step3":"We’re all here if you need us. I hope this lantern will make this journey easier for you by lighting up the way.","Quest.asia_3.step1":"Okay, this looks like the first sign of something truly unbelievable that’s about to happen.","Quest.asia_3.step2":"I couldn’t agree more, Lizzy. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We still have a long way to go.","Quest.asia_4.step1":"Look how cute this rabbit is. I hope it can lead us to the evidence we are looking for.","Quest.asia_4.step2":"I just hope that it won’t hop too fast so we can keep up!","Quest.asia_5.step1":"Is this monkey okay? It looks like its eyes will pop out any second!","Quest.asia_5.step2":"It’s not a monkey, Axel. It's Tarsius. For your information, it has a very advanced vision. I bet it can find the rest of the objects faster than you!","Quest.asia_6.step1":"I wish Archibald invented the way to make animals talk. It would’ve saved us some time.","Quest.asia_6.step2":"All in good time, Axel. I have no doubt that we will eventually find everything we need to find.","Quest.asia_7.step1":"Oh my God, I can’t believe how cute this panda is! I think I understand now why you dedicated your life to animals.","Quest.asia_7.step2":"I appreciate it, Lizzy. And I couldn’t be happier to have someone to share my passion with!","Quest.asia_8.step1":"Hey, Lisa, since we’re on a tropical island, did you ever think what’s your spirit animal?","Quest.asia_8.step2":"Great question, Axel… I need some time to think about it.","Quest.asia_8.step3":"No need to hurry, we will continue our search for these cute creatures while you reflect.","Quest.asia_9.step1":"I know what my spirit animal is, Axel! And no, it’s not a panda.","Quest.asia_9.step2":"Who is it then?","Quest.asia_9.step3":"You would be surprised, but it's probably a lion. I think I can qualify for being the king of the jungle after all I’ve been through lately. How about you?","Quest.asia_9.step4":"I loved your answer so much that I need to take the time to come up with an even better one!","Quest.asia_11.step1":"This garden is in a pretty dire state. I know we’ve seen worse but do you think we can turn it around?","Quest.asia_11.step2":"If someone managed to build it in the first place, we have no excuse not to try and make it even better.","Quest.gnomes_1.step1":"I can’t believe my eyes! Finally!","Quest.gnomes_1.step2":"Oh my god, Axel. You scared me. What’s happening?","Quest.gnomes_1.step3":"My best friend is back. This boomerang belongs to him. You got to help me find him!","Quest.gnomes_1.step4":"First of all, I didn’t know that you had a best friend and that he was gone. Secondly, I’ll need more information if you need my help.","Quest.gnomes_2.step1":"Look, Lisa! Another confirmation that he is back.","Quest.gnomes_2.step2":"Okay, Axel. I am happy to see you so excited, but who is he, and why was he gone?","Quest.gnomes_2.step3":"I’ll explain everything, don’t worry. Let’s just find his next tool first! ","Quest.gnomes_3.step1":"Alright, Axel. The deal is a deal. I am all ears!","Quest.gnomes_3.step2":"What can I say, Keoki is the guardian of the island. He was born and raised here, and he knows how to talk to the local spirits. At least he says that he knows.","Quest.gnomes_3.step3":"Sounds fascinating. I would really love to meet him.","Quest.gnomes_3.step4":"Yeah, but first we have to find him.","Quest.gnomes_4.step1":"Do you know where he went?","Quest.gnomes_4.step2":"To look for your grandpa. He packed all of his tools and left the minute we realized that Archibald was missing. That’s one of the reasons I am so excited to see him.","Quest.gnomes_4.step3":"Do you think he might have something?","Quest.gnomes_4.step4":"I don’t know. But we will soon find out!","Quest.gnomes_5.step1":"How did you become best friends?","Quest.gnomes_5.step2":"When I came to the island, I knew no one and had nothing. He Gave me a roof under my head. Gave me the job. Introduced me to your grandpa.","Quest.gnomes_5.step3":"He will be proud when he learns how you too helped me feel at home here.","Quest.gnomes_6.step1":"Is Keoki friends with uncle Roger?","Quest.gnomes_6.step2":"Of course, he is friends with everyone. You won’t be an exception. When he sits down and plays his drum everyone around fills with joy.","Quest.gnomes_7.step1":"Why does this necklace look so familiar?","Quest.gnomes_7.step2":"It is made of the similar gems we use to clear the island.","Quest.gnomes_7.step3":"Oh, right! I hope Keoki will have something to say about the mysterious ways of the island.","Quest.gnomes_8.step1":"I am not sure that the two of us will be able to carry all of these items around. And you’re saying they all belong to one person?","Quest.gnomes_8.step2":"Yes. But to a very strong person who can easily carry the two of us around. Alongside all of his belongings.","Quest.gnomes_9.step1":"Decided to make yourself the queen of the island? You had a good grip ever since you were a little girl!","Quest.gnomes_9.step2":"No, uncle Roger. We’re tracing Axel’s best friend.","Quest.gnomes_9.step3":"Keoki is back? Why did nobody tell me?! Come on, let me help you!","Quest.shark_1.step1":"Um, Elena. You lost something.","Quest.shark_1.step2":"What is it, Lizzy?","Quest.shark_1.step3":"It looks like a bandage for animals.","Quest.shark_1.step4":"Oh, it’s not mine. But I know exactly who lost it!","Quest.shark_2.step1":"Strange. Very strange.","Quest.shark_2.step2":"What do you mean? This Thermometer looks pretty normal to me.","Quest.shark_2.step3":"We were supposed to find the owner of the bandage here. Not another one of her belongings.","Quest.shark_2.step4":"Who are we looking for exactly?","Quest.shark_3.step1":"So, who is the mysterious owner of these pretty self-explanatory things?","Quest.shark_3.step2":"It’s my girlfriend. My ex-girlfriend. She was very busy with her vet practice so we took a break. Now she’s missing and I am nervous.","Quest.shark_3.step3":"Don’t worry! I know who might help us find her.","Quest.shark_4.step1":"How are you, aunt Gloria? Can I call you aunt Gloria?","Quest.shark_4.step2":"I am splendid, my dear. And yes, darling. You can call me anything you want!","Quest.shark_4.step3":"I hope you’re done watering the plants because you’re being invited to an adventure. As you can guess, we’re looking for a local vet. ","Quest.shark_4.step4":"Count me in, girls. If there is anyone who can find her, that’s us.","Quest.shark_5.step1":"Another clue! Do you think we can trace her back?","Quest.shark_5.step2":"It depends. When was the last time you saw her, Elena?","Quest.shark_5.step3":"At the dinner party thrown by Jenny a couple of weeks ago.","Quest.shark_5.step4":"Well, now we know where to dig further!","Quest.shark_6.step1":"Sorry, guys, I don’t have anything ready to eat at the moment. But if you wait, I can put a few appetizers together.","Quest.shark_6.step2":"It might seem strange to you but we're not after your cooking skills. We’re looking for someone and we have a reason to believe that you might know where she is. ","Quest.shark_6.step3":"Yes, I saw this syringe before… And I know where Bethany is.","Quest.shark_7.step1":"So, Jenny, can you kindly tell us more about Beth’s whereabouts? We keep on finding her belongings but not her…","Quest.shark_7.step2":"Just promise me that you will keep it to yourself. She cannot know that it was me who told you.","Quest.shark_7.step3":"Of course, your secret is safe with us.","Quest.shark_8.step1":"When Archibald discovered a way to bring different creatures to life, he needed someone capable to take care of them.","Quest.shark_8.step2":"Of course… That’s why she was so busy all the time. And I thought that she didn’t want to be together anymore.","Quest.shark_8.step3":"But why did grandpa tell Beth about it but not uncle Roger? Or anyone else…","Quest.shark_8.step4":"Actually, he also told me… I am supposed to cook for the creatures.","Quest.shark_9.step1":"I must say it hurts to be the last one to know the truth.","Quest.shark_9.step2":"Don’t be sad, darling. Archibald must have had his reasons. Maybe he was trying to protect you.","Quest.shark_9.step3":"Protect me from what?","Quest.shark_9.step4":"I don’t know… But there is something we should find out!","Quest.fish_1.step1":"Uncle Roger, I can't believe it! This compass has Grandpa's initials. Isn't this the one you gave him?","Quest.fish_1.step2":"Yes, it is! This find is extraordinary, Lisa. It means we're closer to uncovering the truth about his disappearance.","Quest.fish_1.step3":"We have to keep going. If we can find more of his belongings, we might finally solve the mystery surrounding Grandpa.","Quest.fish_2.step1":"Look, everyone! I found this old flask, and it has this strange symbol engraved on it. Do you think it's Grandpa Archibald's?","Quest.fish_2.step2":"That symbol... I've seen it in his journal before. What could it mean?","Quest.fish_2.step3":"Archibald did have a flask with a mysterious symbol. This could be a clue to the mystery surrounding his disappearance. We must keep going and stay vigilant!","Quest.fish_2.step4":"","Quest.fish_3.step1":"Hey, look at this fedora I found! It looks like something straight out of an adventure movie.","Quest.fish_3.step2":"Hold on, that fedora looks exactly like the one Grandpa Archibald used to wear! He was so proud of it. He always told me they should make a film based on him.","Quest.fish_3.step3":"Yes, that's Archibald's fedora alright! It seems our adventure is taking a fun twist. Keep your eyes peeled, everyone. We're onto something!","Quest.fish_4.step1":"Guys, look what I found wedged between the rocks during my morning hike! Did any of you lose it?","Quest.fish_4.step2":"I remember Archibald using a hammer like this on our expeditions. We must be retracing his steps. Let's see where this leads us!","Quest.fish_5.step1":"I believe we have found the essential item that will lead us to my grandpa!","Quest.fish_5.step2":"I know it’s bad manners, but do you think we have every reason to read it without Archibald’s consent?","Quest.fish_5.step3":"Way ahead of you! \"Day 45: I've stumbled upon an ancient secret that could change everything. I must proceed cautiously.\" This is incredible, team. Archibald was onto something big! We must follow his trail to uncover the truth.","Quest.fish_6.step1":"This is unbelievable! I've found a map among the pages of Grandpa's journal.","Quest.fish_6.step2":"A map? That's fascinating. It could be the key to solving the mystery!","Quest.fish_6.step3":"This looks like no ordinary map. There are cryptic symbols and markings. We'll need to decipher it to uncover Archibald's secrets and find out where he went.","Quest.fish_7.step1":"I found this flashlight on the ground. It seems like it's been here for a while.","Quest.fish_7.step2":"That looks like the flashlight Grandpa Archibald always carried with him on his adventures!","Quest.fish_7.step3":"Indeed, it does. It appears we're still on the right track. Let's keep following the map and stay prepared for whatever comes our way.","Quest.fish_8.step1":"Look, a rock climbing rope. It seems like someone used it to climb up the mountains.","Quest.fish_8.step2":"Grandpa was an expert climber. He must have left it behind. We should follow this path upwards.","Quest.fish_9.step1":"I found these binoculars on a rock ledge. They look like they've been here for a while.","Quest.fish_9.step2":"Those binoculars resemble the ones Grandpa used to have. He probably used them to survey the area. Maybe he was trying to find something important or keep an eye on something hidden.","Quest.fish_9.step3":"You're right. With the mysterious symbols on the map and the journal entry, it's clear Archibald was onto a big secret. His disappearance might be connected to whatever he was observing with these binoculars.","Quest.warcraft_1.step1":"Roger, look what I've found! An ancient collar with symbols of the Canine Tribe.","Quest.warcraft_1.step2":"The Canine Tribe? You mean like dogs and wolves?","Quest.warcraft_1.step3":"Exactly! These creatures are known for their special abilities. Let's embark on a quest to find them!","Quest.warcraft_2.step1":"Look at this, Lisa! An egg with dog-like patterns and... are those ears?","Quest.warcraft_2.step2":"Fascinating! It resembles the eggs of the legendary Canine Tribe.","Quest.warcraft_2.step3":"The tribe from the island legends? The guardians of the ancient Canine Sanctuary?","Quest.warcraft_2.step4":"Yes, exactly! If we've found this egg, they could be here on the island, in need of our help. We should investigate further.","Quest.warcraft_3.step1":"This must be one of the canines from the ancient tribe. It's incredible!","Quest.warcraft_3.step2":"This puppy could be the key to uncovering the mystery of the Canine Tribe. We should look after it and continue our exploration.","Quest.warcraft_3.step3":"Absolutely! I'll take care of it while we find the rest of its family.","Quest.warcraft_4.step1":"Wow, this is a French Bulldog! I didn't expect to find one here.","Quest.warcraft_4.step2":"Maybe the Canine Tribe was more diverse than we thought. Perhaps they had connections with different breeds all over the world.","Quest.warcraft_4.step3":"This bulldog could have traveled far and wide before settling with the tribe. We're onto something big here.","Quest.warcraft_4.step4":"I'll keep an eye on this little guy too. Let's see what else we can uncover about this tribe.","Quest.warcraft_5.step1":"What an adorable Corgi! It's a breed famous for being the favorite of the British royalty.","Quest.warcraft_5.step2":"So, the tribe was somehow connected to all these different places? Britain, France... It's becoming more intriguing.","Quest.warcraft_5.step3":"Seems like our Canine Tribe had quite the global reach. There's more to this story than meets the eye.","Quest.warcraft_5.step4":"Isn't it exciting? We're literally unearthing history here. Let's keep going!","Quest.warcraft_6.step1":"Look at this majestic Airedale Terrier, it's known as the 'King of Terriers' you know.","Quest.warcraft_6.step2":"King, huh? The tribe sure had a royal taste.","Quest.warcraft_6.step3":"I'm starting to see a pattern here. All these breeds are known for their distinctive features and roles in society.","Quest.warcraft_6.step4":"There's definitely a grander tale to uncover. Each breed is a piece of the puzzle.","Quest.warcraft_7.step1":"A Golden Retriever! They're so friendly and intelligent.","Quest.warcraft_7.step2":"They were often used in search and rescue missions because of their keen sense of smell and tracking instincts.","Quest.warcraft_7.step3":"Perhaps the tribe had them as companions in their adventures and explorations around the island.","Quest.warcraft_7.step4":"An island full of secrets, surrounded by mysteries, and watched over by loyal, intelligent dogs. Fascinating...","Quest.warcraft_8.step1":"This breed is a Sheepdog, they're known for their herding skills. But what would they herd here?","Quest.warcraft_8.step2":"Perhaps the tribe bred them to keep the island's wild animals in check.","Quest.warcraft_8.step3":"Or maybe they were the tribe's companions, providing protection.","Quest.warcraft_8.step4":"Whatever the reason, it seems they were integral to the tribe's life here. The mystery deepens...","Quest.warcraft_9.step1":"Look at this Dalmatian! The spots are so distinctive. But I can't recall any legends about them.","Quest.warcraft_9.step2":"Perhaps the tribe admired their unique markings, or there might be a deeper symbolic meaning we're yet to uncover.","Quest.warcraft_9.step3":"Well, let's keep our eyes open for any clues. Each discovery brings us closer to understanding the tribe's connection with these animals.","Quest.warcraft_9.step4":"And closer to revealing the true purpose of our quest. I can't wait to uncover more!","Quest.warcraft_10.step1":"A hyena? That's an odd choice. I thought we were dealing with domestic canines.","Quest.warcraft_10.step2":"True, hyenas are more distantly related, but they still have a place in the canine family tree. Perhaps the tribe saw their unique social structure and communication skills as something to admire.","Quest.warcraft_10.step3":"Or maybe they appreciated their resilience and adaptability. Hyenas can survive in a variety of habitats and are formidable hunters.","Quest.warcraft_10.step4":"Either way, they were important enough to be included in this quest. Let's keep going, we are on the brink of a major discovery!","Quest.warcraft_12.step1":"This too must be a piece of the puzzle, despite its abandoned look.","Quest.warcraft_12.step2":"According to the legend, there was an ancient Canine Resort. A sanctuary where all the canines lived in harmony with the tribe.","Quest.warcraft_12.step3":"It seems the tribe had a deep connection with the canines, they respected them, even revered them. This resort was not just a home, but a place of unity.","Quest.warcraft_12.step4":"Apparently, it's up to us now to restore this sanctuary and continue their legacy. Are you ready, team?","Quest.warcraft_12.step5":"We're more than ready, let's get to work!","Quest.panda_1.step1":"These earrings look familiar... Oh no, Grandpa. Tell me it's not what I think it is. I beg you!","Quest.panda_1.step2":"I am sorry, Lisa. Vivienne deserved to know that I was back. She said she will come visit us on the island but I didn't expect it to happen so soon.","Quest.panda_1.step3":"Um, who's Vivienne? And who brings such fancy earrings to a tropical island?","Quest.panda_1.step4":"Exactly! And now it seems like she's lost. Classic Vivienne. Now I have to find her despite the fact that I have about an infinity other things that I would better do...","Quest.panda_2.step1":"Is that...lipstick? I didn't know anyone on the island wore such vibrant colors!","Quest.panda_2.step2":"Well, Marina, my granddaughter Vivienne is anything but ordinary. She enjoys standing out, and she would certainly stand out here on the island.","Quest.panda_2.step3":"Another granddaughter, Archibald? I've never heard of her before.","Quest.panda_2.step4":"That's because Vivienne and I don't... we don't get along too well. But she's still family. We need to find her.","Quest.panda_3.step1":"A makeup case? Now, that's a peculiar item to find in the jungle. More peculiar for it to belong to a Whitlock.","Quest.panda_3.step2":"Indeed, Roger. That's my Vivienne. Always making a statement. I suppose even in the middle of a tropical island she wants to ensure her makeup is perfect.","Quest.panda_3.step3":"This sounds like someone I would like to meet. A dash of glamour could certainly make things around here more interesting.","Quest.panda_3.step4":"Let's just find her quickly. Knowing Vivienne, she's probably in some kind of trouble already...","Quest.panda_4.step1":"Are these... designer sunglasses? They must be Vivienne's. I can't imagine anyone else on this island who would need them.","Quest.panda_4.step2":"That's Vivienne for you. Never seen without her sunglasses, even indoors.","Quest.panda_4.step3":"It's just one of her little quirks. But if she's lost them, she can't be far. We need to keep looking.","Quest.panda_4.step4":"It's like a tropical version of a glamorous scavenger hunt. I kind of like it!","Quest.panda_5.step1":"Wow, this lei necklace is beautiful. It's got some fancy designer tag on it. I bet it's Vivienne's.","Quest.panda_5.step2":"Typical Vivienne... Can't even wear a simple flower necklace without it being branded.","Quest.panda_5.step3":"Now, Lisa, remember your manners. Vivienne might not share your... simplicity, but she's still family.","Quest.panda_5.step4":"I remember very well, Grandpa. That's the problem.","Quest.panda_6.step1":"Well, this hat certainly stands out. A designer piece too. I wonder who the owner is...","Quest.panda_6.step2":"Her excessive love for fashion... It's always been her thing.","Quest.panda_6.step3":"Each to their own, Lisa. Your sister finds joy in fashion, just as you do in exploring. It doesn't make her any less.","Quest.panda_6.step4":"If only she understood that as well as you do, Grandpa.","Quest.panda_7.step1":"Archibald, can I speak to you in private while others examine this phone? What's this tension between Lisa and Vivienne?","Quest.panda_7.step2":"Well, Axel, there's a lot of history there. When they were kids, Vivienne was always the charming one, the social butterfly. Lisa was more introverted, dedicated to her studies. That created...a rivalry of sorts.","Quest.panda_7.step3":"I see... And I suppose Vivienne showing up out of the blue doesn't help.","Quest.panda_7.step4":"No, it doesn't. But I believe they will figure it out. After all, they're family.","Quest.panda_8.step1":"Those are definitely Vivienne's... she always had a flair for fancy footwear. Even when coming to a tropical island.","Quest.panda_8.step2":"I think they're cool, Aunt Lisa. I mean, a little over the top for here, but still stylish.","Quest.panda_8.step3":"It's not about the sandals, Marina... It's about her showing up uninvited and causing a stir.","Quest.panda_8.step4":"I get it, Aunt Lisa. Family stuff can be complicated. But maybe Aunt Vivienne has changed?","Quest.panda_8.step5":"I really hope so, Marina. I really do.","Quest.panda_9.step1":"Look what I found! It's... well, I'm not sure what it is. It's made of nice materials, though!","Quest.panda_9.step2":"Keoki, that's a handbag.","Quest.panda_9.step3":"A hand-bag? But why would anyone need to carry their hands in a bag?","Quest.panda_9.step4":"No, Keoki, it's a bag for carrying things in. Like a backpack, but usually for smaller items.","Quest.panda_9.step5":"Ah, I see! Still, it seems very small. I could not fit many coconuts in there.","Quest.panda_9.step6":"It's not for coconuts, Keoki. Though, knowing Vivienne, she may have tried that once.","Quest.steampunk_1.step1":"This egg is unlike anything we've seen before. The intricate patterns don't match any local species.","Quest.steampunk_1.step2":"You're right, Lisa. It could indicate a new, unknown species. Let's continue investigating.","Quest.steampunk_2.step1":"How fascinating, a Kookaburra! You wouldn't typically find these birds here.","Quest.steampunk_2.step2":"True. Not just that, it has a medallion. Similar to those we've found on other animals. But why?","Quest.steampunk_2.step3":"This medallion... Could it be related to grandpa's research? We should ask him, he might know something about this.","Quest.steampunk_3.step1":"Here we are again with another creature that's got one of those medallions. This time it's a Bilby.","Quest.steampunk_3.step2":"Our new friends seem to carry the same medallions, and if my investigative intuition serves me right, they aren't just ornamental pieces. They might be carrying a piece of a larger puzzle.","Quest.steampunk_3.step3":"Indeed, Bruce. I believe these medallions are a sort of bridge from their homeland to ours. Each one could represent a virtue from their world that they're here to share.","Quest.steampunk_3.step4":"Grandpa, you mean they're like ambassadors? That's fascinating! Let's see what we can learn from them and help them in their mission.","Quest.steampunk_4.step1":"Check this out, another newcomer! This is a Numbat. And would you look at that, it has a medallion too.","Quest.steampunk_4.step2":"A Numbat, fascinating. These animals and their medallions are here for a reason. They're linked in some way.","Quest.steampunk_4.step3":"Archibald, you seem to know a lot about these medallions. Have you encountered them before?","Quest.steampunk_4.step4":"A long time ago, yes. I believe these medallions are keys, bridges even. We should pay close attention to these creatures and what they might teach us.","Quest.steampunk_5.step1":"This one is an Echidna, and it also carries a medallion. Grandpa, what's the connection here?","Quest.steampunk_5.step2":"I designed these medallions, Lisa, as a link between two distant realms. I thought I could bridge the gap, but I became lost in the process.","Quest.steampunk_5.step3":"So, these animals, they're travelers like you?","Quest.steampunk_5.step4":"Exactly, Bethany. And we should do our best to learn from them and make them feel welcome while they're here.","Quest.steampunk_6.step1":"A Platypus! With a medallion no less. Archibald, how do we assist these travellers?","Quest.steampunk_6.step2":"Well, Marcel, it starts with understanding. Observe them, learn from them. These creatures are full of wisdom.","Quest.steampunk_6.step3":"And look, the medallions resonate with each other. They're stronger together, like us.","Quest.steampunk_6.step4":"Very true, Elena. We must strive to unite their virtues, just as they unite us.","Quest.steampunk_7.step1":"Wow, a Wombat now! Just look at it, so peculiar and yet so endearing.","Quest.steampunk_7.step2":"Not just that, Lisa. Notice its medallion? It's resonating just like the others. They're forming some kind of a sequence.","Quest.steampunk_7.step3":"Indeed, they are Bruce. The sequence is the key to deciphering the language of their realm. Keep going, my friends. You're on the right path.","Quest.steampunk_8.step1":"Woah, look at the vibrant colors on that Cockatoo! Almost outshines my surfboard!","Quest.steampunk_8.step2":"You'd do well to learn more than just its colors, Marina. It's a complex creature.","Quest.steampunk_8.step3":"Elena is correct. It carries another piece of the puzzle, as do all these unique creatures. Remember, we must respect and learn from them, just as I did during my time in their realm.","Quest.steampunk_9.step1":"A Koala! Its medallion feels... different. More potent, somehow.","Quest.steampunk_9.step2":"Good observation, Lisa. Each medallion grows stronger, reflecting the growing bond between our worlds. We're approaching a significant breakthrough. We must press on.","Quest.steampunk_9.step3":"Indeed. There's more to these cuddly creatures than meets the eye.","Quest.steampunk_10.step1":"This Emu looks majestic! But its medallion... feels almost electric.","Quest.steampunk_10.step2":"Yes, the medallions are reacting more as we get closer to fulfilling the prophecy. It's a sign of progress.","Quest.steampunk_10.step3":"We've come a long way. And to think, it all started with a strange egg!","Quest.steampunk_12.step1":"Hey, everyone, look at this. It looks like an Oasis, but it's empty... and it's in terrible shape.","Quest.steampunk_12.step2":"Hm... Feels like it's been abandoned. But why? Who could've left a place like this to wither?","Quest.steampunk_12.step3":"I'm afraid only a thorough renovation will give us the answers we seek. Whatever this place once was, it carries the weight of the past.","Quest.steampunk_12.step4":"And maybe, it's up to us to breathe life back into it! Who knows what secrets it might reveal!","Quest.steampunk_12.step5":"Agreed, we should make it our mission to restore this place. It might be a long process, but I'm sure it will be worth it.","Quest.steampunk_12.step6":"Then it's decided. Let's roll up our sleeves and bring this place back to its former glory. Let the adventure continue!"},"rapunzel_json":{"Units.rprapunzel.name":"Eleonora","Units.rprapunzel.stage1.name":"Pan","Units.rprapunzel.stage2.name":"Cupcake","Units.rprapunzel.stage3.name":"Lantern","Units.rprapunzel.stage4.name":"Flower","Units.rprapunzel.stage5.name":"Palette","Units.rprapunzel.stage6.name":"Dress","Units.rprapunzel.stage7.name":"Young

We can use it to signal the princess our location.","Quest.rpcomb_3.step1":"Apparently, princess’ hair possesses magic powers.","Quest.rpcomb_3.step2":"Why doesn't she use it to find her way back?","Quest.rpcomb_3.step3":"She’s missing the hair brush required to activate them. If only we could find a way to bring it to her…","Quest.rpanimals_3.step1":"You know what? I was thinking that if we can’t get the job done it might not be such a bad idea to delegate it to our four-legged friends.","Quest.rpanimals_3.step2":"I am so desperate to find the princess so I am willing to try anything!","Quest.rpdress_3.step1":"Don't you have a feeling that this castle is one giant wardrobe? How many dresses are enough...","Quest.rpdress_3.step2":"This does not surprise me since we are in the princess' chambers. I bet your house is full of your things too.","Quest.rpdress_3.step3":"Yes. The only difference is that I don't have a handsome prince who is always ready to come to the rescue.","Quest.rpdress_3.step4":"Speaking about the prince, let’s find the rest of the garments and bring them to him.","Quest.rpchameleon_3.step1":"What a cute little creature. Did you ever dream about having a pet?","Quest.rpchameleon_3.step2":"Even if I did, it would not be a chameleon.","Quest.rpchameleon_3.step3":"Why not?","Quest.rpchameleon_3.step4":"It becomes impossible to find one when it mimics the surroundings. So once we have it, we should bring it to the prince before it disappears.","Quest.rprapunzel_1.step1":"The princess must be somewhere nearby. This pan has her initials on it.","Quest.rprapunzel_1.step2":"It’s a good sign. Let’s keep looking!","Quest.rprapunzel_2.step1":"What a wonderful cupcake! You can tell that the princess made it.","Quest.rprapunzel_2.step2":"I guess cooking is just one of her many talents. Let’s see what else we can find!","Quest.rprapunzel_3.step1":"Do you think the princess left the lanterns behind so she can find her way back home?","Quest.rprapunzel_3.step2":"Or so that we can trace her!

Why is it glowing?","Quest.rprapunzel_4.step2":"I think the princess is the right person to ask this question. Let’s find her to get all the answers!","Quest.rprapunzel_5.step1":"Did you know that the princess loves to paint?","Quest.rprapunzel_5.step2":"I am not surprised. We saw her talents displayed before.","Quest.rprapunzel_5.step3":"I am starting to think that she painted this castle…","Quest.rprapunzel_5.step4":"I bet she regrets not drafting its map.","Quest.rprapunzel_6.step1":"Did you ever wonder what a princess’ dress might look like?","Quest.rprapunzel_6.step2":"I am more curious if she made it herself.","Quest.rprapunzel_6.step3":"I think we saw enough evidence of her various skills. Sewing a dress, how hard can it be?","Quest.rprapunzel_6.step4":"Let’s make more and find out!","Quest.rprapunzel_7.step1":"We know that Eleonora is somewhere in the castle and that we can only find her if we all work together.","Quest.rprapunzel_7.step2":"That is indeed the case. If we manage to remove the fog and find all the clues, make no mistake, the princess will be saved.","Quest.rprapunzel_7.step3":"Alright then. Let's proceed with collecting the ingredients and see where we can find the first clue!","Quest.rprapunzel_7_2.step1":"It seems like this castle is still full of surprises!","Quest.rprapunzel_7_2.step2":"And the young princess here is kind enough to guide us through them. Are you ready for another adventure?","Quest.rprapunzel_7_2.step3":"Sure I am! Let's split and find what else hides behind that fog!","Quest.rpcentaur_0_2.step1":"We haven't been properly introduced yet but we don't have time for pleasantries!

You're here for a reason.","Quest.rpcentaur_0_2.step4":"Alright, alright. What should we begin with?","Quest.rptelescope_0.step1":"If my calculations are correct, and they are, there is a meteorite coming our way. I know how to set it off course, but my telescope is missing a unique lens. I need your help with that.","Quest.rptelescope_0.step2":"Sounds easy enough. Just tell us where we can get the lens.","Quest.rptelescope_0.step3":"Get the lens? You can't just get it, we need to make it using the rarest materials and my patented technology. Just go to the mine. My minions are expecting you.","Quest.rptrolley_0.step1":"Hey, guys. Your boss told us that we can collect some unique resources required to produce some unique lenses. Do you know anything about it?","Quest.rptrolley_0.step2":"Of course, we've been learning to mine it for the longest time to stop the meteorite. The thing is...","Quest.rptrolley_0.step3":"Let me guess, your partner is littered with stones? Don't feel bad, we've all been there.","Quest.rptrolley_0.step4":"Thanks. We would have to rescue him before we can rescue the world.","Quest.rptrolley_1.step1":"Thanks for saving me. I will have to check the breaks on our trolley but first let me return the favor by clearing that rubble.","Quest.rptrolley_1.step2":"It seems like time is of the essence here. So let's all work together to make things faster.","Quest.rptrolley_2.step1":"Oops, we've underestimated the damage.","Quest.rptrolley_2.step2":"What do you mean?","Quest.rptrolley_2.step3":"The trolley we use to collect the resources is broken.","Quest.rptrolley_2.step4":"Don't you worry about it. We're second to none when it comes to fixing things. It will be done lickety-split!","Quest.rptrolley_3.step1":"You weren't lying. You're good at fixing stuff. Well, let us show you how fast we can mine resources. ","Quest.rppress_1.step1":"It looks like the collapse affected the crane too. Do you have experience fixing heavy machinery?","Quest.rppress_1.step2":"Do we have experience fixing heavy machinery? Please, we can fix anything even if it's not broken.","Quest.rpcrane_1.step1":"Oh my god, Alvin will kill us! We've broken his press. Without it, we can produce lenses for the telescope.","Quest.rpcrane_1.step2":"In that case, it might be the meteorite that kills you.","Quest.rpcrane_1.step3":"Don't worry, guys. It's an easy fix. We just need to find all the spare parts and work in tandem.","Quest.rpdoorway_0.step1":"Why are all of the books piled up? Whoever did this clearly didn't understand what kind of treasure was in his possession. ","Quest.rpdoorway_0.step2":"Or maybe someone was trying to hide some other treasures they might have had. Let's clean this up and find out!","Quest.rpdoorway_1.step1":"The books keep on coming our way. Maybe it's a sign that we should read more?","Quest.rpdoorway_1.step2":"I think after we clean this mess up we will officially become the most well-read janitors in the world.","Quest.rpdoorway_2.step1":"Finally! No more books. It looks like we're done here.","Quest.rpdoorway_2.step2":"Aren't you curious to find out what hides behind this door?","Quest.rpdoorway_2.step3":"I am. But what if there are more books? I would not survive this.","Quest.rpdoorway_2.step4":"I promise you, even if we stumble on just a page, we will immediately abandon this endeavor and indulge ourselves with something less sophisticated.","Quest.rpdoorway_3.step1":"To be honest, I am scared to go inside.","Quest.rpdoorway_3.step2":"Don't be. Fortune favors the brave! ","Quest.rpprincehero_1.step1":"Have you seen the prince? I think he lost his gloves.","Quest.rpprincehero_1.step2":"He went to get a gift for the princess to celebrate her return but got lost himself...","Quest.rpprincehero_1.step3":"That's horrible! We must save him too.","Quest.rpprincehero_2.step1":"Here comes the hat. We're getting closer.","Quest.rpprincehero_2.step2":"I wouldn't get your hopes up. The castle is even bigger than we thought before... ","Quest.rpprincehero_3.step1":"He wouldn't get too far without his boots, would he?","Quest.rpprincehero_3.step2":"No, but what if he had a spare pair? As far as I am concerned, he can be anywhere so we should search every last corner.","Quest.rpprincehero_4.step1":"Oh no, the poor prince lost his saber. What if he gets in trouble in the dungeon or something even worse happens?","Quest.rpprincehero_4.step2":"In that case, we should probably try and find him as soon as possible rather than contemplating this misfortune.","Quest.rpprincehero_5.step1":"The sight of this medal calms me down.","Quest.rpprincehero_5.step2":"Why is that?","Quest.rpprincehero_5.step3":"It's evidence of the fact that the prince can stand up for himself if it comes to that.","Quest.rpprincehero_5.step4":"Still, we should hurry up to find him. Who knows what other secrets this castle might have?","Quest.rpprincehero_6.step1":"What a gorgeous doublet. I think we owe it to the prince to reunite him with it.","Quest.rpprincehero_6.step2":"I couldn't agree more. Let's hope that we are getting closer!","Quest.rapunzel2_chop.step1":"Let's provide the princess with the ingredients so she could help us reveal the castle's secrets!","Quest.rptelescope_open.step1":"And what should we do?","Quest.rptelescope_open.step2":"Let's keep looking.

I already tried to reach Marina but she’s got no reception.","UnitStory.bear_5.step3":"Then, I guess, finding her ourselves is the only option. Especially, since we’re almost there!","UnitStory.bear_6.step1":"Grandpa, aren’t you too old to walk that much? You could’ve just called.","UnitStory.bear_6.step2":"What is it with you girls and your phones? Check your signal the next time you go that far.","UnitStory.bear_6.step3":"Oops, sorry about that. Is there something I can help you with?","UnitStory.bear_6.step4":"Yes. We are looking for Archibald. What was the last place you saw him?","UnitStory.elf_5.step1":"This is it. Gloria must be somewhere near. She never leaves her watering can alone for too long.","UnitStory.elf_5.step2":"That’s so sad.","UnitStory.elf_5.step3":"What is?","UnitStory.elf_5.step4":"The fact that things didn’t work out for you two despite you knowing her so well. I’m pretty sure that all is forgiven!","UnitStory.elf_6.step1":"Hey, Gloria, happy to see me?","UnitStory.elf_6.step2":"Roger Hart. To what do I owe the pleasure?","UnitStory.elf_6.step3":"We have a little team here with a mission to find Archibald and save the island.","UnitStory.elf_6.step4":"Well, for such a noble cause I’m willing to leave the past behind and move forward!","UnitStory.magicplant_8.step1":"We did it, Lizzy! Are you ready to try this thing out?","UnitStory.magicplant_8.step2":"To be honest, I’m a little scared but I don’t remember the last time I was so excited.","UnitStory.magicplant_8.step3":"Don’t worry, everything is going to be fine. After all, the spirits of the island are always looking after us.","UnitStory.fruitshop_0.step1":"Did you know that there was a fruit kiosk on the island?","UnitStory.fruitshop_0.step2":"I'm starting to think that I know nothing about the place where I've spent my whole life... ","UnitStory.fruitshop_0.step3":"Don't be so dramatic. Let's find out what it has to offer!","UnitStory.resourceshop_0.step1":"Look, Lisa, I've found a store too.","UnitStory.resourceshop_0.step2":"What do they sell there?","UnitStory.resourceshop_0.step3":"I have no idea but probably something useful for restoring the island!","UnitStory.discountshop_0.step1":"I've noticed how much do you like shopping. I know just a place for you!","UnitStory.discountshop_0.step2":"It better be something really special since I already know where to get my fruit and resources.","UnitStory.discountshop_0.step3":"Don't worry. I wouldn't waste your time on something that basic. The gems you can find here will make the island shine!","UnitStory.warlock_6.step1":"Look at the size of that thing! We can use it to transport goods to other islands.","UnitStory.warlock_6.step2":"I don’t think so. It looks like a small passenger boat to me.","UnitStory.warlock_6.step3":"Let’s find its owner and ask what is it used for.","UnitStory.warlock_7.step1":"Excuse me, does this boat belong to you?","UnitStory.warlock_7.step2":"Yes, it’s my water taxi.","UnitStory.warlock_7.step3":"Did you by any chance take my grandpa anywhere?","UnitStory.warlock_7.step4":"Why don’t we sit down and talk about the ways we can help each other.","UnitStory.bamboo_8.step1":"I must admit, these sheep do look adorable.","UnitStory.bamboo_8.step2":"I'm so glad we're on the same page, uncle Roger. Because we're not finished yet and your help will be much appretiated.","UnitStory.bamboo_10.step1":"I know that this whole thing was my idea but even in my wildest dreams I couldn’t imagine that it will turn out to be so great!","UnitStory.bamboo_10.step2":"That’s what we do, uncle Roger. Now I can enjoy our life here even more by watching the sheep grow.","UnitStory.bamboo_10.step3":"Don’t take too long though. I have another crazy idea cooking up!","UnitStory.sapphire_9.step1":"I wonder how far they can fly? What if they don’t like it here and decide to leave.","UnitStory.sapphire_9.step2":"Not very far. But don’t worry. They’ll be taken such good care of that they won’t want to leave. Ever!","UnitStory.sapphire_11.step1":"We’ve done a wonderful job. Again.","UnitStory.sapphire_11.step2":"Thank you for your help! Again…","UnitStory.sapphire_11.step3":"You’re always welcome. Do let us know when you have your next crazy idea.","UnitStory.sapphire_11.step4":"It will be my pleasure!","UnitStory.ruins_0.step1":"It’s an ancient fountain, Lizzy! We have an hour to throw something in it and make a wish.","UnitStory.ruins_0.step2":"Just an hour? Let me look for some change!","UnitStory.ruins_0.step3":"Choose your wish wisely and remember that we only have 60 minutes and the countdown is already started!","UnitStory.troll_7.step1":"That is some heavy backpack. Do you think she’s headed somewhere?","UnitStory.troll_7.step2":"Elena always has a lot of stuff with her since it’s very unpredictable what she will decide to do next.","UnitStory.troll_7.step3":"This is exactly what I’m trying to understand. Let’s find her and ask then!","UnitStory.troll_8.step1":"Axel, what are you doing here?","UnitStory.troll_8.step2":"Hey, sis! We just wanted to ask you a few questions.","UnitStory.troll_8.step3":"Sure. And who are \"we\"?","UnitStory.troll_8.step4":"Let me introduce you to Lisa. I think you two have a lot of catching up to do!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_0.step1":"Can someone, please, explain to me what’s happening?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_0.step2":"I wish I could, Lisa. Maybe this tree can help us solve Archibald’s riddle.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_0.step3":"Are we even sure that he is here?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_0.step4":"No. But he is the only one who could’ve opened this portal and we were savvy enough to follow in his footsteps.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_1.step1":"I wish dragons could talk. It seems like they know all the things we are desperately trying to find out.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_1.step2":"Don’t give up just yet. We still don’t know what this tree is capable of. Let’s keep looking!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_2.step1":"I still can’t wrap my head around the fact that grandpa discovered a floating island full of dragons!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_2.step2":"Yes, it’s hard to believe. But I’ve known Archibald long enough to accept every possibility.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_2.step3":"Did he already pull something like this off?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_2.step4":"Not really, but he was born to explore and it looks like his experiments were not in vain.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_3.step1":"May I ask who you are and what are you doing here?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_3.step2":"Sorry for intruding, we mean no harm. We are just looking for my grandpa, Archibald Whitlock.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_3.step3":"Maybe you know him? We have a reason to believe that he was here before us.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_3.step4":"I’m not ready to discuss the island’s affairs with invaders. You have to prove that intentions are good first. ","UnitStory.drbattlepass_4.step1":"How are we supposed to prove our good intentions? Maybe we should just go back.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_4.step2":"I think if we do, we’ll lose Archibald’s trace forever. Let’s not give up just yet!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_5.step1":"Please, tell us what we have to do. We don’t have much time.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_5.step2":"You can start with doing something good for the island. How about clearing it?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_5.step3":"But we already got rid of so many stumps…","UnitStory.drbattlepass_5.step4":"It’s okay. We’re the best at landscape design. Give us some time and you won’t recognize the island!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_6.step1":"Why do we have to put up with her behaviour? Grandpa is missing and she doesn’t seem like she wants to help.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_6.step2":"Calm down, Lizzy. It’s her island so we should play by her rules. After all, we’re second to none when it comes to island renovation so let’s enjoy the process!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.step1":"How do you manage to stay so composed, uncle Roger?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.step2":"I’m just fascinated by this place. You are aware of my affection for different creatures and dragons are no exception.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.step3":"No wonder grandpa and you are best friends. His passion for discoveries and your sympathy make a killer combination!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_8.step1":"So, what do you think? Is it good enough for you?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_8.step2":"The island looks better, no doubt about that. But as your uncle said, you’re the best at what you do. I think you’re yet to reach your peak.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_8.step3":"Is this a joke? We’re running out of time here. Just tell us where my grandpa is and we will be out of your hair.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_8.step4":"I don’t mind you staying for as long as you want here. Especially since you have a lot of work to do.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_9.step1":"I can’t believe you, uncle Roger! Why would you do that?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_9.step2":"What do you mean, Lizzy?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_9.step3":"You couldn’t help it but brag about how good we are at renovating islands! And now we’re stuck here with this stubborn dragon of a woman!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_10.step1":"I know you’re upset, Lizzy, but maybe you can find it in your heart to finish what we have started?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_10.step2":"I’m not sure if I can, uncle Roger. I started nothing so I have nothing to finish here. I guess, this is where our paths diverge.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_11.step1":"Do you have any idea what we should do about Lisa?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_11.step2":"Not yet. But let me talk to her. I hope I can figure something out.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_11.step3":"Okay, Axel. I hope you know what you’re doing. I’ll try to finish the renovation without Lisa but it won’t be easy…","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.step1":"Hey, Lizzy! How are you doing?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.step2":"I feel lost.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.step3":"It’s okay. We all do sometimes…","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.step4":"No, I’m literally lost. Can you point me in the direction of the portal so I could go back home?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_13.step1":"How did it go?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_13.step2":"Not ideal. She is determined to leave.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_13.step3":"I think it’s the second saddest thing I ever heard after the news about Archibald’s disappearance.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_13.step4":"Don’t give up your hopes just yet. You’re not the only ones here blessed with the ability to talk.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.step1":"Did you come to show me the way out?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.step2":"No, I came to ask you to stay.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.step3":"And why is that?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.step4":"Because I know Archibald Whitlock and I want to help you.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_15.step1":"So, you know my grandpa. But why didn’t you say so in the beginning? ","UnitStory.drbattlepass_15.step2":"My trust growth as the dragon tree gets bigger. I needed to make sure that your hearts are pure.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.step1":"It’s so nice to have you back, Lizzy.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.step2":"I’m sorry I overreacted, uncle Roger.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.step3":"Not at all. I want to find your grandpa as much as you do. So I totally get it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.step4":"Thank you. Now, let’s finish what we’ve started!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.step1":"I was a little scared back there, you know. I thought I lost you. I mean, we lost you. I must admit that this dragon lady is a much better negotiator.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.step2":"Don’t be so harsh on yourself, Axel. You were great. I was just too stubborn to admit my own mistakes.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.step3":"I will forever remember the day when Lisa Whitlock said that she was wrong.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.step4":"Just don’t let me regret it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_18.step1":"Can you, please, tell us more about my grandpa?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_18.step2":"I’m afraid I don’t know much. I only saw him once when he opened the portal. He told me that he will do everything in his power to protect it from others.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_18.step3":"How did we manage to enter it, then?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_18.step4":"He said that the only person who would be able to open it again will be his granddaughter.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_19.step1":"I don’t understand. How did grandpa know that I will find the portal?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_19.step2":"What if everything he did was his way to guide you?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_19.step3":"Do you mean like laying the breadcrumbs for me to collect?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_19.step4":"Yeah, something like that. I think that the story is just beginning to unfold…","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.step1":"Pardon my curiosity, but I have to know how do you feed the dragons?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.step2":"They are herbivore creatures so I let them eat as many leaves as they could find.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.step3":"Well, in that case, you’re more than welcome to visit our island. It’s also floating, but on water. The best part being that it’s full of greens!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.step4":"Thank you for the invitation. We’ll definitely think about it!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_21.step1":"I think we did a pretty good job with this island. It might even be better looking than our tropical paradise…","UnitStory.drbattlepass_21.step2":"You think? Wait until we’re done with this place. The dragons won’t recognize it!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_22.step1":"I think that the tree will outgrow the island if we keep on going.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_22.step2":"Trust me, the tree knows its limits. It will stop getting bigger once the island is in a perfect state.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_23.step1":"Are you ready to accept the challenge, uncle Roger?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_23.step2":"Are you talking about perfecting the island? Please, I can brush it up with my eyes closed.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_24.step1":"I can’t believe my eyes, Lizzy! You did it again.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_24.step2":"What do you mean, Axel?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_24.step3":"You made another island shine. I think it’s time for you to start your own island renovation company.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_24.step4":"Only if you agree to be my right hand.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_25.step1":"This is it. The Dragon tree reached its peak. So did the island. All thanks to you!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_25.step2":"Don’t mention it. It was a blast spending time here with you and your dragons.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_25.step3":"Feel free to come back any time. Our portal is always open for you.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_25.step4":"Thank you. Let’s hope that the next time we visit you is going to be with my grandpa!","UnitStory.snow_9.step1":"I’m so glad that we had this conversation. It’s nice to know that even after all these years grandpa can still surprise me.","UnitStory.snow_9.step2":"Yes, I believe it’s what he does best.","UnitStory.snow_9.step3":"Do you think he would approve of what we’ve done with the island so far?","UnitStory.snow_9.step4":"Are you kidding? He would’ve loved it. He is a big fan of crocodiles too. So we could name one of them Archibald! ","UnitStory.snow_11.step1":"We did a great job, Lisa. I hope we can find your grandpa soon so he could see for himself what an adventurer his granddaughter turned out to be.","UnitStory.snow_11.step2":"Thank you, Elena. I believe that with your help we can actually do that.","UnitStory.knight_9.step1":"Would you also be interested in a tobacco pipe, uncle Roger?","UnitStory.knight_9.step2":"A hat and a pipe? Do you want me to look like a detective?","UnitStory.knight_9.step3":"Uncle Roger, you’re a genius. A detective! That’s whom we’re looking for. I hope he will help us with our search.","UnitStory.knight_10.step1":"Welcome to the island, Mr. Barrymore.","UnitStory.knight_10.step2":"To whom do I have the pleasure of talking to?","UnitStory.knight_10.step3":"I’m Lisa Whitlock. It’s so nice to meet you. I have so many questions to ask you.","UnitStory.knight_10.step4":"I have a few questions of my own, Ms. Whitlock. Is there a safe place we can discuss them?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_0.step1":"Well, uncle Roger, we’re finally underwater like you wanted it. Are we here to rescue this raft?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_0.step2":"First of all, it’s what Archibald wanted, not me. I found a photo of a ship in his office. There was a note on its back: \"Seek, and you will find. Ocean Pearl, 1427.\"","UnitStory.seabattlepass_0.step3":"That’s where you got the coordinates from?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_0.step4":"Yes. And the tridents. Archibald is a man of few words. So we better listen when he has to say something. Let’s find this ship so we could find your grandpa.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_1.step1":"I must admit I was skeptical at first, but it seems like your theory is working. I guess if we go through enough watercraft, we’ll get to the Ocean Pearl eventually.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_1.step2":"I hope we can also figure out what are they all doing here, on the bottom of the ocean… ","UnitStory.seabattlepass_2.step1":"Have you been underwater before, Axel?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_2.step2":"No, I haven’t. But guess who has? My sister, of course. She told me all about it. How beautiful and diverse it is, how deep it can be, how many species there are. Falling asleep already?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_2.step3":"Not at all. I’m curious how much of what she said you find to be true.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_2.step4":"Well, let me put it this way. I’ve seen things much more gorgeous than an ocean depth.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_3.step1":"How many watercraft should we go through before finding the one from the picture?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_3.step2":"If only I knew, Lizzy. But if I was told that I have to go through a million of them to find Archibald, I would do it in a heartbeat!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_4.step1":"I know that you love animals, but how about the sea creatures?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_4.step2":"You can find beauty in every living organism. No matter where or who.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_4.step3":"The size of your heart is second to none, Lizzy. I’ll do my best to help you find your grandpa.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_5.step1":"Some of the vessels look very fragile. No wonder they sunk.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_5.step2":"I’m not much of a sailor myself, but I know for a fact that the water can be dangerous and unpredictable sometimes. I’m sure there is a reason for all of them being here. We just need to find it.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_6.step1":"Was grandpa a good sailor, uncle Roger?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_6.step2":"The best. I remember the day he came to the island. It was very stormy, but he made it without letting a single drop touch his clothes.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_6.step3":"And how about you?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_6.step4":"I prefer to stay dry on the land.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_7.step1":"How long do you think it will take us to find the Ocean Pearl? Are we even sure that it’s a real thing?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_7.step2":"We have already learned on several occasions that everything related to your grandpa happens for a reason.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_7.step3":"You’re right. I know it does but sometimes it’s hard to stay patient.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_8.step1":"Do you think we’ll recognize the ship when we see it? It might’ve looked different in the picture. A lot of time has passed since 1427. ","UnitStory.seabattlepass_8.step2":"That’s a good point, Lizzy. We’ll have to make sure that the nameplate is visible before jumping to any conclusions.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_9.step1":"If you feel tired, you can sit back and relax. I can do this all day.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_9.step2":"Where did this obsession with watercraft come from?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_9.step3":"I don’t know for sure but I like to think that it’s somewhat related to the fact that I was born on a boat.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_10.step1":"Hmm, this looks familiar. Is this what we were looking for?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_10.step2":"It looks nothing like the Ocean Pearl. I think your helmet is all fogged up. Let’s keep looking!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_11.step1":"Look, guys! We did it. We found the Ocean pearl.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_11.step2":"I can’t believe my eyes. I guess grandpa’s footprints always lead to something.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_11.step3":"Let’s search it. Maybe we can find our next clue there.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_12.step1":"You won’t believe what I just found.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_12.step2":"Another photo with another note?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_12.step3":"So much better! There is proof that the Ocean Pearl was one of the first vessels set to discover our tropical archipelago way back in 1427. But it has never reached it…","UnitStory.seabattlepass_12.step4":"How curious… And what about the rest of the watercraft?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_12.step5":"That is another question but I’m sure we can find an answer to it too.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_13.step1":"Do you have any idea what all of this means? And why do these ships keep on coming?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_13.step2":"I’m just a guy with an awesome beard, not a marine scientist. Let’s ask the real expert!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_14.step1":"No, Axel, it has nothing to do with aliens. I’m sure that there is a much more sophisticated explanation.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_14.step2":"Okay, sis. Then, by all means, help us find it.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_14.step3":"Sure, let me talk to the fish first.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_15.step1":"I knew you were smart but I didn’t know that you could talk to fish.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_15.step2":"Not literarily, silly. I just looked around for the samples and other visual clues that could suggest a certain theory. This is the term we use in biology.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_15.step3":"I don’t need to know all that. Just give me the facts. Did you find anything or not?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_15.step4":"Be patient, Axel. It’s an exact science and it requires precision. Give me some time and I’ll have an answer for you.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_16.step1":"Have you ever heard about the Bermuda Triangle?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_16.step2":"Of course, it’s a famous urban legend. Every kid here knows about it. Am I right, Marina?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_16.step3":"Sure, but I never thought of it as a legend.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_16.step4":"And you were right to do so.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_17.step1":"Are you saying that we’re dealing with some sort of mysterious disappearance kind of situation?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_17.step2":"It’s not as mysterious for me, but, yes, this is the basic idea.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_17.step3":"What do you think about it, guys?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_17.step4":"I think that we need more information…","UnitStory.seabattlepass_18.step1":"What do all these vessels have in common?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_18.step2":"They are sitting on the bottom of the ocean…","UnitStory.seabattlepass_18.step3":"Yes. And how did they all get here?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_18.step4":"The same way we did?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_18.step5":"Bingo!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_19.step1":"Oh my god, I can’t believe that Archibald found the Bermuda Triangle.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_19.step2":"It’s more of a portal. All of the watercraft that were \"lucky\" enough to also come across it ended up here.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_20.step1":"What should we do now with all these vessels?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_20.step2":"I have an idea but I’m not sure if you’re going to like it.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_20.step3":"I helped you with all of your other projects no matter how crazy they were.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_20.step4":"Fair enough. How would you like to find all of the missing ships and send them back home?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_21.step1":"I’m so proud of you, Lizzy. You’re doing something truly meaningful. You and Archibald have so much in common.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_21.step2":"Thank you, uncle Roger. It means a lot. I’m just happy that my grandpa was somehow able to discover the island without getting his ship to sink.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_21.step3":"That’s Archibald Whitlock. He always finds a way. And you will too!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_22.step1":"I didn’t have a chance to properly thank you for all the help.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_22.step2":"Don’t mention it, Lisa. We all want to find your grandpa as much as you do.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_22.step3":"And now I’m sure that with your knowledge we will be able to do that no matter what! ","UnitStory.seabattlepass_23.step1":"I know that nobody will share my feelings, but I don’t want this quest with watercraft to end. Ever.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_23.step2":"Just make sure that your boat stays away from the portal. ","UnitStory.seabattlepass_23.step3":"I am not even sure if it can go this far after all it has been through…","UnitStory.seabattlepass_23.step4":"Don’t worry, we’ll do our best to get you a new one after we’re done here.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_24.step1":"Have you ever been on a cruise before?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_24.step2":"I was too busy to live my life before I came back to the island.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_24.step3":"I know that you have a lot on your plate at the moment, but maybe, just maybe, we can go on a trip together someday?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_24.step4":"That would be lovely, Axel!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_25.step1":"We did it, guys! All the watercraft are saved. Great job, you all!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_25.step2":"Don’t mention it, Lizzy. We would do anything for you and Archibald. I wish that we had our own Ocean Pearl that we could use to find your grandpa, wherever he might be.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_25.step3":"Why not keep the original one for a while? Who knows where else it can take us? In the meantime, Santa Cruz can start working on our own ship. How does \"Tropical Pearl\" sound to you?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_25.step4":"I can't wait to start already!","UnitStory.kraken_0.step1":"What is the oldest tradition here on the island?","UnitStory.kraken_0.step2":"Fishing, of course! We can use the tropical amulets to lure the fish and then trade it to get rewards.","UnitStory.caravanship_0.step1":"Would you be so kind and let me know when you see a ship full of exquisite exotic goods on the horizon?","UnitStory.caravanship_0.step2":"Umm, I’m seeing it right now. You didn’t say it was that pretty.","UnitStory.caravanship_0.step3":"Hooray! The tropical carnival has finally reached us! We should hurry up and take advantage of the best offers!","UnitStory.cinema_0.step1":"Hey, Lizzy, did you grandpa like to watch movies?","UnitStory.cinema_0.step2":"His life was more exciting than most of the films, so I don’t know… Why do you ask?","UnitStory.cinema_0.step3":"I found this Clapperboard and was wondering if it has something to do with Archibald.","UnitStory.cinema_1.step1":"Do you think one of his expeditions is on these reels?","UnitStory.cinema_1.step2":"I’m not sure. It can be anything. Let’s keep looking and we’ll find the answers!","UnitStory.cinema_2.step1":"Uncle Roger, do you know if my grandpa used to make videos about his travels?","UnitStory.cinema_2.step2":"Who, Archibald? Ha-ha-ha. He might be the greatest adventurer but he is awful with technology. This camera is for a local project.","UnitStory.cinema_2.step3":"What local project?","UnitStory.cinema_2.step4":"Help me find more equipment and you will see for yourself.","UnitStory.cinema_3.step1":"Wow, it’s an actual cinema!","UnitStory.cinema_3.step2":"Tropical cinema, if you will. You can click on it any time and exchange your views for a variety of great items! ","UnitStory.cinema_3.step3":"Sounds lovely! Let’s watch something and collect our rewards!","UnitStory.bank_0.step1":"Hey Lizzy, you know how the island prospered after your arrival? Well, I think it’s time to take the next step.","UnitStory.bank_0.step2":"Oh, stop it, uncle Roger. I’m just doing the best I can. What are you suggesting?","UnitStory.bank_0.step3":"We already have the exchange, why not have the bank? It would be nice to get some tropical interest!","UnitStory.bank_0.step4":"What a great idea! Why didn’t we think of it before? I'm already looking forward for all the benefits.","UnitStory.hunter_9.step1":"Do you think this will work?","UnitStory.hunter_9.step2":"Sometimes you just have to make the leap of faith and hope for the best. Even if no one replies, we still got each other. And we won’t stop until we find Archibald.","UnitStory.hunter_9.step3":"Thank you, Axel. It’s time to send some letters!","UnitStory.hunter_10.step1":"Excuse me, are you the local postman?","UnitStory.hunter_10.step2":"Indeed I am. I came to take your letters.","UnitStory.hunter_10.step3":"Do you by any chance know my grandpa, Archibald Whitlock?","UnitStory.hunter_10.step4":"Yes. He was the one who dispatched me here from Paris.","UnitStory.fog_fog4_0.step1":"You did not think that time stood still at the island, did you?","UnitStory.fog_fog4_0.step2":"How do you mean, Uncle Roger?","UnitStory.fog_fog4_0.step3":"We developed more efficient ways to merge while you were away. See for yourself with the hay!","UnitStory.fog_fog4_0.step4":"Sounds exciting and intriguing, Uncle Roger. Watch me become the merge expert!","UnitStory.lava_9.step1":"Oh my god, I thought all saber-toothed animals were extinct.","UnitStory.lava_9.step2":"So did I. As it turns out, this island is even a more special place than we thought.","UnitStory.lava_9.step3":"I wish Archibald could see it evolve and grow…","UnitStory.lava_11.step1":"Just look at it! Isn’t it beautiful?","UnitStory.lava_11.step2":"What a great job you did, guys. Thank you so much!","UnitStory.lava_11.step3":"Don’t mention it, uncle Roger. Let’s run to the store and get some cat litter!","UnitStory.centaur_8.step1":"And here is chef’s hat! Can you find to whom it belongs, Bruce?","UnitStory.centaur_8.step2":"Already on it!","UnitStory.centaur_9.step1":"Hi, Mrs. Oliver. We wanted to return your tools and ask you a few questions. If you don’t mind.","UnitStory.centaur_9.step2":"Wow, thank you, guys! It’s so nice of you. I guess they got lost during my move here.","UnitStory.centaur_9.step3":"You moved here too recently? How interesting. So, do you mind the questions?","UnitStory.centaur_9.step4":"Not at all, go ahead!","UnitStory.sand_9.step1":"Look, uncle Roger. We found another dinosaur as per your request. Can you, please, tell us what’s happening now?","UnitStory.sand_9.step2":"I think I found the reason behind Archibald’s disappearance. Let’s finish what he started by building the Dinopark.","UnitStory.sand_11.step1":"Why do you think grandpa left? Was he scared of his own creation?","UnitStory.sand_11.step2":"Your grandpa is fearless. He just wanted to protect us and the island from the consequences of his discovery. ","UnitStory.sand_11.step3":"What exactly did he find?","UnitStory.sand_11.step4":"A way to recreate any creature. And I have a reason to believe that we will get another chance to test this hypothesis.","UnitStory.asia_9.step1":"I believe we finally found what we were looking for… You really are the greatest mind, Archibald!","UnitStory.asia_9.step2":"Awesome! Dibs on dragon being my spiritual animal!","UnitStory.asia_9.step3":"I still cannot wrap my head around this, but I can’t wait to finish what my grandpa has started.","UnitStory.asia_11.step1":"So, now we know the potential reason for Archibald’s disappearance. What should we do about it? And about all these fantastic creatures populating the island.","UnitStory.asia_11.step2":"I can take care of the creatures, don’t worry.","UnitStory.asia_11.step3":"And I shall keep looking for my grandpa. Now I have even more reasons to do it.","UnitStory.asia_11.step4":"Who said that you will do it alone? We’re a team, Lisa. We will follow you wherever you go. ","UnitStory.gnomes_9.step1":"Is Keoki the king of the island?","UnitStory.gnomes_9.step2":"No, we are all equals here. He is just too big.","UnitStory.gnomes_9.step3":"What do you mean?","UnitStory.gnomes_9.step4":"He means that Keoki is so massive no ordinary chair will be able to accommodate him without falling apart.","UnitStory.gnomes_10.step1":"It is really you, old friend. You have no idea how happy I am to see you!","UnitStory.gnomes_10.step2":"Likewise, dear Axel. I am glad to be home. Give me a hug!","UnitStory.gnomes_10.step3":"So, how was your adventure?","UnitStory.gnomes_10.step4":"Eventful to say the least. I have news. Something to discuss while sipping a tiki cocktail!","UnitStory.shark_9.step1":"Well, it must be it. Bethany told me that she will travel with her dog. I really hope that you find the answers you’re looking for.","UnitStory.shark_9.step2":"Thank you for your help, Jenny. The creatures are very lucky that you’re cooking for them!","UnitStory.shark_10.step1":"Bethany! You have no idea how happy I am to see you.","UnitStory.shark_10.step2":"The feeling is mutual, Elena. I am glad that you found me.","UnitStory.shark_10.step3":"My friend here has a couple of questions for you.","UnitStory.shark_10.step4":"Hi, Bethany! I am Lisa Whitlock, Archibald’s granddaughter and I could really use your help finding him…","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_0.step1":"Would you be so kind as to tell us why are we back here? And aren't you supposed to recover after the surgery first?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_0.step2":"Please don’t say that more ships have sunk.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_0.step3":"Be patient, I will explain everything soon.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_1.step1":"Although the ships are fine, the underwater island itself needs to be taken care of.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_1.step2":"A few unnoticeable cracks have appeared since our last visit so we decided to erect our basecamp here. We have twenty days to do it.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_1.step3":"Building an underwater station on such short notice sounds like a hard thing to do so I can’t do it without you. Will you help me?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_1.step4":"Of course! If there is one thing past experience taught us, it is that it’s easier to carry heavy materials underwater than it is on land.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_2.step1":"Are you happy to be back? The local architecture looks very authentic.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_2.step2":"On the one hand, I just dried off from the last time. On the other one, I had a blast saving those ships.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_2.step3":"And they say that you can’t walk into the same river twice…","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_2.step4":"Technically, it’s not a river. So we should be good!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_3.step1":"Do you really think we can build our headquarters here? Saving sunken vessels is one thing, subaquatic construction is completely another.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_3.step2":"I wouldn’t have taken on this challenge if I hadn’t had you by my side.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_3.step3":"It’s good that the pressure feels different underwater. Otherwise, my hands would be shaking.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_4.step1":"Will you consider moving here if the building turns out alright?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_4.step2":"First of all, there are no ifs. It will be great! And secondly, why not? I can be the Gatekeeper of the Underwater.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_4.step3":"You know what? This is probably the fanciest way to call a night watchman. Good for you!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_5.step1":"How is the construction going?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_5.step2":"Everything is great. We’re making history here. All thanks to you!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_5.step3":"Don’t thank me, thank your grandpa for all the blueprints.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_6.step1":"I’ve been thinking, what if we build an aquarium on our island and call it the Underwater quarters?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_6.step2":"Are you getting attached to the local fish?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_6.step3":"No. I don’t know. Maybe a little bit.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_6.step4":"Don’t worry, you can always come and stay here whenever you feel like visiting them.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_7.step1":"Do you find undersea construction easier? After all, the water is doing all the heavy lifting.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_7.step2":"I always told you that if you work with your head, you can make things easier for yourself, land or water.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_7.step3":"Anyway, I am glad that we were able to build this stunner so fast.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_8.step1":"Are we still on schedule? I am not trying to push you. Just wondering if everything is going according to plan.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_8.step2":"Let me run a few tests. This will help evaluate the progress.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_8.step3":"Sure thing. The building does look great so I can’t wait to see it finished!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_9.step1":"Is everything okay? You look less cheerful than usual.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_9.step2":"Everything is fine. At least for now. I have a reason to worry but it hasn’t been confirmed yet. Just keep going, you’re doing great! ","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_10.step1":"Guys, I think we might have a problem.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_10.step2":"What is it?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_10.step3":"I have a reason to believe that our materials aren’t suitable for underwater construction.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_11.step1":"I think you worry too much. The building looks just fine.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_11.step2":"I ran some extended tests that showed that it will be washed out over time.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_11.step3":"Should we stop the construction?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_11.step4":"No. We’ve come too far already. I just need to find a way to alter the destruction process.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_12.step1":"I must admit, I became attached to our base camp. And it’s not even finished yet.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_12.step2":"Me too. Do you think Santa Cruz will find a solution?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_12.step3":"I hope so. He knows more about water than all of us combined. If he won’t, I don't know who will!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_13.step1":"I heard of the problem, Santa Cruz. How are you doing?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_13.step2":"News travels fast, Roger. It’s not my brightest moment but I’ll try my best to find the solution.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_13.step3":"I have an idea. Let’s gather the team to discuss it.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_14.step1":"You wanted to see us?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_14.step2":"First of all, the building looks amazing.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_14.step3":"Thank you, uncle Roger. There is a caveat, though…","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_14.step4":"I know. That’s why we are all here. We must all do our best if we want to succeed.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_15.step1":"What are you suggesting, uncle Roger?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_15.step2":"I know that Santa Cruz is an expert in water but it’s impossible to come up with the required solution while being here without the proper tools.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_15.step3":"He should go back to the island and work on the formula in your grandpa’s office while I take over the construction in his stead.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_15.step4":"Thank you, Roger. I promise not to come back without a solution!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_16.step1":"I know that you're great, uncle Roger, but do you think we can manage without Santa Cruz?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_16.step2":"I look at what you accomplished so far and do not doubt our success. Not even for a second! It can easily change, though, if we keep talking instead of working.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_16.step3":"Roger that!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_17.step1":"I can confirm that Santa Cruz has reached the island safely and buried himself in the office under books whose titles I can’t even read.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_17.step2":"Thanks for the update, Marina. Do you like what you see?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_17.step3":"Let me put it this way, grandpa. It will be a tragedy if Santa Cruz doesn’t find a solution.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_18.step1":"Even if we can’t find a way to make this building last forever, I really enjoyed constructing it.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_18.step2":"Agreed! But if justice exists, then it will prevail!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_19.step1":"Any news from Santa Cruz?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_19.step2":"I am afraid not. Nobody has left or entered the office since we last spoke.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_19.step3":"Alright then. This building deserves to be finished anyway. Let’s make it the best we can. The rest is not up to us.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_20.step1":"There is still work left to do but not that much time left. I think it’s my turn to roll up my sleeves.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_20.step2":"Are you sure? You know what the doctor said...","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_20.step3":"Yes. I also know what my heart tells me and I will always listen to it while it keeps beating!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_21.step1":"I can’t believe my eyes! What are you doing? The doctor told you not to get involved in any activities.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_21.step2":"I am just trying to be a part of the team. The greatest team I’ve had a chance to work with!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_22.step1":"Sorry to interrupt, grandpa. But there is news. News you would all like to hear.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_22.step2":"It’s better to be good, Marina. I was quite enjoying myself on the construction site. Look at that beauty!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_22.step3":"It’s Santa Cruz! He is coming back as fast as he can.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_23.step1":"How do you like the news, guys?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_23.step2":"It’s great! Did he come up with a solution?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_23.step3":"This is something we have to hear from him.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_23.step4":"Let's welcome him back with our best work, then!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_24.step1":"Santa Cruz! It’s so good to see you. Even if this building turns to dust tomorrow.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_24.step2":"I am happy to see you too. And don’t you worry about the building. It took longer than I expected, but the formula is ready. We just need to apply it.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_25.step1":"What a fantastic job, guys. All of you! I know that I said it a million times already, but you’re the best team anyone can wish for.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_25.step2":"Thank you, uncle Roger! It feels good to be a part of it.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_25.step3":"And to work alongside a genius! How were you able to turn things around, Santa Cruz?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_25.step4":"I don’t want to bore you with the details. Let’s just say that I had no option to fail since you were doing the best you can!","UnitStory.fish_9.step1":"I came across this old backpack hidden behind some bushes. It's filled with supplies and tools, even some old photographs and letters.","UnitStory.fish_9.step2":"This backpack must belong to Archibald. Judging by the contents, it seems he left it here intentionally, possibly as a final clue.","UnitStory.fish_9.step3":"With all the items we've found, we must be very close to discovering Archibald's whereabouts. Let's keep moving forward and stay vigilant. Grandpa might just be around the corner!","UnitStory.fish_10.step1":"Grandpa Archibald! We finally found you!","UnitStory.fish_10.step2":"My dear Lisa, and all of you, I'm amazed you managed to follow the trail I left behind.","UnitStory.fish_10.step3":"It wasn't easy, Archibald, but we were determined to solve the mystery of your disappearance.","UnitStory.fish_10.step4":"I'm proud of all of you. But now that you're here, there's something you need to know. The secret I discovered, it's... it's something beyond our wildest imaginations, hidden right here on this island!","UnitStory.warcraft_10.step1":"A wolf, really? This tribe must've really respected the canine family. Wolves symbolize loyalty, intelligence, and are known as great communicators.","UnitStory.warcraft_10.step2":"They are also pack animals, just like us humans. They rely on each other to survive, just like we do on this island.","UnitStory.warcraft_10.step3":"Each canine we've discovered has been a step on this journey. I wonder what the final piece of this puzzle will be.","UnitStory.warcraft_10.step4":"Whatever it is, I'm certain it will embody the unity and respect the tribe held for these creatures. Ready to find out?","UnitStory.warcraft_12.step1":"Just look at it now! The Canine Resort restored to its former glory, standing as a beacon of harmony and unity.","UnitStory.warcraft_12.step2":"You can almost hear the echoes of the past, the joyous barks and howls of the canines, the laughter of the tribe. We've done something truly special here.","UnitStory.warcraft_12.step3":"Aye, we have. This place is more than just a resort, it's a testament to a relationship that transcended species. A bond built on respect, trust and love.","UnitStory.warcraft_12.step4":"The legend of the tribe and their canine companions lives on through this place. And we'll make sure it's a story that continues to be told.","UnitStory.warcraft_12.step5":"Indeed, but this island still has many secrets to reveal. We've restored the Canine Resort, but who knows what's waiting for us next?","UnitStory.steampunk_10.step1":"The last medallion! We're so close to finally unlocking the secret.","UnitStory.steampunk_10.step2":"I can't believe grandpa, you were working on such an amazing project!","UnitStory.steampunk_10.step3":"It was my life's work, Lisa. And soon, we will see the fruits of that labor.","UnitStory.steampunk_10.step4":"I wonder what will happen when we complete the collection!","UnitStory.steampunk_12.step1":"It's a… It's an Oasis! All these animals, living together in harmony! This is amazing!","UnitStory.steampunk_12.step2":"Just like I'd hoped. A piece of their homeland, right here on our island.","UnitStory.steampunk_12.step3":"Aussie Oasis, huh? Fitting name. You really outdid yourself, Archibald.","UnitStory.steampunk_12.step4":"This was always the goal, my friends. To learn from each other and create a place of unity. Thank you all for helping bring this vision to life.","UnitStory.steampunk_12.step5":"You're right, grandpa! It’s all about unity and acceptance. Let's do our best to make these new friends feel at home.","UnitStory.steampunk_12.step6":"Couldn’t agree more, Lisa. Well then, let’s get started. There’s so much to learn from them!","UnitStory.panda_9.step1":"This is... this is her dress. She was here!","UnitStory.panda_9.step2":"Well, Lisa, it looks like Vivienne's trail is fresh. We should find her soon.","UnitStory.panda_9.step3":"Why does it feel like a storm is approaching, Grandpa?","UnitStory.panda_9.step4":"Because, my dear, storms often precede the arrival of Starlights.","UnitStory.panda_9.step5":"Well, let's hope this storm brings some rainbows with it too.","UnitStory.panda_9.step6":"That's a nice way to put it, Axel. We sure could use a rainbow right about now.","UnitStory.panda_10.step1":"Vivienne…","UnitStory.panda_10.step2":"Lisa, it's been a while.","UnitStory.panda_10.step3":"Vivienne, you've always had a flair for making an entrance.","UnitStory.panda_10.step4":"What's life without a little surprise, Grandpa?","UnitStory.panda_10.step5":"You sure have an interesting family, Archie.","UnitStory.panda_10.step6":"Well, Vivienne, now that you're here, we have a lot to discuss.","UnitStory.panda_10.step7":"I agree, Lisa. Let's put the past behind and start anew.","UnitStory.thanksgiving_0.step1":"Look at this! It is a new item! But how did it appear and what to do with it?","UnitStory.thanksgiving_0.step2":"This is a Thanksgiving item. Merge any objects from level two and above to receive Thanksgiving items, and when you collect all of them, you'll get a new unique landmark!

These bells will be exchanged for wreaths, the magical key to restoring the island's attractions.","UnitStory.xmproducer2a_0.step2":"As we prepare to spread this magic, I can't help but wonder, what cast such a shadow over Christmas Island?","UnitStory.xmproducer2a_0.step3":"I overheard the workshop keeper mention a spell, a dark force leeching the joy from our surroundings.","UnitStory.xmproducer2a_0.step4":"A spell?

We'll light up the island, wreath by wreath, breaking the spell and bringing back the true spirit of Christmas.","UnitStory.xmproducertrash_0.step1":"We've just met with the local Christmas enthusiast.

We find bells for his collection, and in return, we get useful items to help us spread holiday joy around the island."}}
